# Column comments in Vertica can only happen on Projections
#   https://forum.vertica.com/discussion/238945/vertica-try-to-create-comment
# And Vertica projections follow this naming:
#   https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/Projections/WorkingWithProjections.htm
# So to fetch column comments we need to concat the table_name + projection infix + column name.
# Example: querying `v_catalog.comments` we find an object_name for a column in the table vendor_dimension as
# `vendor_dimension_super.vendor_name`. Note how this is the `_super` projection.
# Then, our join looks for the match in `vendor_dimension_super.vendor_name`.
# In case there are more than one projections available for a table then we pick up
# comments from any one projection available for table
# Note: This might not suit for all column scenarios, but currently we did not find a better way to join
# v_catalog.comments with v_catalog.columns.
