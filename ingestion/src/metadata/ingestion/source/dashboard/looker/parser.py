    Parses and caches the visited files & views.

    Here we'll just parse VIEWs, as we are already getting
    the explores from the API.

    The goal is to make sure we parse files only once
    and store the results of the processed views.

    We want to parse the minimum number of files each time
    until we find the view we are looking for.

    Approach:
    When we parse, it is because we are looking for a view definition, then
    1. When parsing any source file the outcome is
        a. Look for any defined view, and cache it
        b. The parsing result is the list of includes
    2. Is my view present in the cache?
        yes. Then return it
        no. Then keep parsing `includes` until the response is yes.
