Comprehensive unit tests for parser.get_connection_class() fallback mechanism
Tests for Issue #22920 - Scalable solution for connection module imports

Background:
-----------
Issue #22920 reported ModuleNotFoundError for SAS connection on Linux systems:
  "No module named 'metadata.generated.schema.entity.services.connections.database.sASConnection'"

Root Cause:
-----------
The old code formula was: source_type[0].lower() + source_type[1:] + "Connection"
For "SAS", this produced "sASConnection", but the actual file is "sasConnection.py".

Case-Sensitivity Issue:
-----------------------
- macOS (case-insensitive FS): Bug was masked, imports worked
- Linux/Docker (case-sensitive FS): Imports failed with ModuleNotFoundError

Services Affected:
------------------
Only 3 out of 47 database services were broken on Linux:
  ❌ SAS     (tried: sASConnection,     actual: sasConnection.py)
  ❌ SQLite  (tried: sQLiteConnection,  actual: sqliteConnection.py)
  ❌ SSAS    (tried: sSASConnection,    actual: ssasConnection.py)

All other 44 services worked correctly because camelCase matched their filenames:
  ✅ BigQuery (bigQueryConnection.py), AzureSQL (azureSQLConnection.py), etc.

The Solution:
-------------
Try-except pattern attempts standard camelCase first, falls back to lowercase.
This automatically handles both naming conventions without hardcoded lists.

Test Strategy:
--------------
This test suite validates:
1. Fallback path works for the 3 affected services
2. Standard path works for 44 unaffected services
3. Edge cases (numbers, acronyms, mixed-case)
4. Comprehensive validation of all 47 services
5. Performance (fallback has negligible overhead)
