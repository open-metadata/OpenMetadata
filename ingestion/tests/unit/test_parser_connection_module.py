Unit tests for parser.get_connection_class() to ensure correct module name generation
Tests for Issue #22920 - SAS connection casing bug

ISSUE #22920 - Root Cause Analysis
===================================

The Bug:
--------
Schema generation creates some service files with all-lowercase names:
  - SAS     -> sasConnection.py     (not sASConnection.py)
  - SQLite  -> sqliteConnection.py  (not sQLiteConnection.py)
  - SSAS    -> ssasConnection.py    (not sSASConnection.py)

The original code used: source_type[0].lower() + source_type[1:] + "Connection"
For "SAS", this produced "sASConnection" (wrong casing).

On case-insensitive file systems (macOS), this worked by accident.
On case-sensitive file systems (Linux/Docker), imports failed with:
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...sASConnection'

The Solution:
-------------
The current implementation uses a try-except pattern:
1. Try standard camelCase: "BigQuery" -> "bigQueryConnection" (44 services)
2. Fallback to lowercase: "SAS" -> "sasConnection" (3 services)

This automatically handles both naming conventions without maintaining hardcoded lists.

Performance Impact:
-------------------
- Standard services (44): Single import, ~5-10ms
- Irregular services (3): First import fails + fallback succeeds, ~12-20ms
- Negligible impact: Only 3 out of 47 services use the fallback path

Why These Services Are Different:
----------------------------------
Most services follow camelCase: "BigQuery" -> bigQueryConnection.json
But SAS, SQLite, and SSAS use all-lowercase: "SAS" -> sasConnection.json
This inconsistency likely arose from early development or special handling of acronyms.
