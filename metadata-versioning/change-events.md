# Change Events

OpenMetadata captures changes in both technical metadata (e.g., table schemas) and business metadata (e.g., tags, ownership, descriptions) as new versions of an entity. Metadata changes generate events that indicates which entity changed, who changed it, and how it changed. You may use these events to integrate metadata into other tools or trigger actions.
