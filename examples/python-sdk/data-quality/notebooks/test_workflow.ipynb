   "source": "# Running Data Quality tests for tables in OpenMetadata\n\nIn the following Notebook we will join two data sources to load into our `Tutorial Postgres.raw.public.taxi_yellow` table.\n\nWe will be using the following two assets from the [NYC Yellow Taxi Ride Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page):\n- [Yellow Taxi Ride for September 2025 (parquet)](https://python-sdk-examples.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/data-quality/yellow_tripdata_2025-09.parquet)\n- [Taxi Zones Lookup (csv)](https://python-sdk-examples.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/data-quality/taxi_zone_lookup.csv)\n\n## Purpose\nWe want to showcase how we can leverage OpenMetadata's data quality mechanisms directly from code. For that, we're simulating a very simple ETL that builds the data for which we have set up data quality tests in the [given instructions](/lab/tree/README.md).\n\n## Description of the ETL\nThe Yellow Taxi Ride dataset contains a couple of columns, Pickup Location ID and Dropoff Location ID, which refer to the zone in which each stop of the ride takes place. Yellow taxis either start or end in one of those zones, but we want to find only those that never leave the yellow area. The Taxi Zones Lookup dataset contains a mapping between the zone ID and the taxi type (e.g: Yellow Zone).\n\nOur ETL will join the two data sources and filter for those of which Pickup and Dropoff location ID are both yellow zones. Since we only want a subset of it, we will also load only 10,000 rows of data to our table.\n\nOnce we've loaded the results to the destination table, we will use the [`openmetadata-ingestion`](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) library to run the Data Quality tests we have defined in [OpenMetadata](http://localhost:8585/table/Tutorial%20Postgres.raw.public.taxi_yellow/profiler/data-quality).\n\n## Dependencies\nFor our ETL we will be using Pyarrow to load the Parquet file, Pandas DataFrames to work with the Taxi Rides and Taxi Zones areas, [`openmetadata-ingestion`](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) to run data quality tests and, since we're using Postgres as a database for our fake Data Warehouse we will need to install dependencies for the OpenMetadata [Postgres Connector](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/connectors/database/postgres). We will also need SQLAlchemy, which is installed by default with `openmetadata-ingestion`.\n\nWe can install all these dependencies specifying the right extras. A full list can be found in the project's [`setup.py`](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/ingestion/setup.py), check it out if your installation differs from the example below.\n\n## Requirements\nIf you haven't, please follow the [setup](/lab/tree/README.md#setup) steps in the README\n\nFor this example you will need:\n\n- An OpenMetadata instance running (achieved by following the setup instructions above)\n- A bot JWT token. You can do so by using [Ingestion Bot's](http://localhost:8585/bots/ingestion-bot) token from your OpenMetadata instance\n- [`openmetadata-ingestion`](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) version 1.11.0.0 or above (installed in this Notebook)"
