   "source": "# Running Data Quality tests for DataFrame\n\nIn the following Notebook we will work with the `Tutorial Postgres.raw.public.taxi_yellow` table from the previous tutorial - [test workflow notebook](/lab/tree/notebooks/test_workflow.ipynb) - and perform some transformations on it before loading it into our staging database.\n\n## Purpose\nWe want to showcase how we can hook OpenMetadata's data quality mechanisms directly in your ETLs before your data reaches its destination. For that, we're building an ETL that transforms the data we previously built and loads it in a table for which we have set up data quality tests in the [given instructions](/lab/tree/README.md).\n\n## Description of the ETL\nFor context, please refer to [the test workflow notebook](/lab/tree/notebooks/test_workflow.ipynb)\n\nIn this case we will run some simple data cleaning and transformations on the dataframe. Then, we will use the `DataFrameValidator` interface to load the chunks of validated data into the destination and then finally report those results to OpenMetadata.\n\nWe will use the [`openmetadata-ingestion`](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) library to run the Data Quality tests we have defined in [OpenMetadata](http://localhost:8585/table/Tutorial%20Postgres.raw.public.taxi_yellow/profiler/data-quality).\n\n## Dependencies\nFor our ETL we will be using SQLAlchemy to load the table, Pandas DataFrames to perform transformations, [`openmetadata-ingestion`](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) to run data quality tests and the OpenMetadata [Postgres Connector](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/connectors/database/postgres).\n\nWe can install all these dependencies specifying the right extras. A full list can be found in the project's [`setup.py`](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/ingestion/setup.py), check it out if your installation differs from the example below.\n\n## Requirements\nIf you haven't, please follow the [setup](/lab/tree/README.md#setup) steps in the README\n\nFor this example you will need:\n\n- To have run the [`test_workflow`](/lab/tree/notebooks/test_workflow.ipynb) notebook\n- An OpenMetadata instance running (achieved by following the setup instructions above)\n- A bot JWT token. You can do so by using [Ingestion Bot's](http://localhost:8585/bots/ingestion-bot) token from your OpenMetadata instance\n- [`openmetadata-ingestion`](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) version 1.11.0.0 or above (installed in this Notebook)"

The first one is pretty similar to the one before and it requires that your code follows the validator's `FailureMode`, which defaults to a short circuit. The second requires that you only define three methods: one that returns chunks of probably transformed dataframes, another that loads chunks and a third that handles errors.\n\nThe validator's default and only (for now) failure mode short-circuits execution of any other test case and stops iterating on the chunks of data if a failure is encountered.
