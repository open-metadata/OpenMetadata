  "description": "This schema defines the change event type to capture the changes to entities. Entity changes due to user activity, such as updating description of a dataset, changing ownership, or adding new tags. Entity also changes due to activities at the metadata sources, such as a new dataset was created, a datasets was deleted, or schema of a dataset is modified. When state of entity changes, an event is produced. These events can be used to build apps and bots that respond to the change from activities.",
