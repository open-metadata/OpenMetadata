## 📋 Additional Deliverables

### ADR Directory Structure Created

```
openmetadata-docs/adr/
├── README.md                      # ADR process documentation
└── ADR-0001-thirdeye-service.md   # ThirdEye architecture decision
```

### Documentation Includes

1. **ADR README.md**: Explains ADR process, format, naming conventions
2. **Complete ADR**: Comprehensive architectural decision record with:
   - Architecture diagrams (ASCII art)
   - Code examples (Java proxy pattern)
   - API routing examples
   - Database strategy
   - Authentication flow
   - Implementation timeline
   - Risk assessment
   - Alternatives analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision Summary

**Key Decision**: ThirdEye as Back-End-to-Back-End Service

```
Client → openmetadata-service:8585 → thirdeye-service:8586 (internal)
         (publicly exposed)           (NOT exposed externally)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single API entry point (port 8585)
- ✅ Unified authentication/authorization
- ✅ Clear domain separation
- ✅ Independent scalability
- ✅ Future-proof architecture

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️ Additional service complexity
- ⚠️ Minimal network hop latency
- ⚠️ Two services to manage

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Post-Approval)

Once this ADR is approved, the next phase will be:

### Phase 1: Service Scaffolding
1. Create `thirdeye-service` Maven module
2. Set up Dropwizard application
3. Configure MySQL database
4. Implement proxy in `openmetadata-service`

### Timeline
- **Planning (this phase)**: Complete ✅
- **Implementation**: 6 weeks (6 phases)
- **MVP (ZI Score)**: 4 weeks
