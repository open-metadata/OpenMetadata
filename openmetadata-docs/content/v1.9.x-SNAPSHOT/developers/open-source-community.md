### Meet & Greet on Slack
That’s where the OpenMetadata enthusiasts are;
apart from [GitHub](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata), of course.

Catch up with all the discussions and queries on the growing world of metadata. Know what other users are looking for and how OpenMetadata contributes to make their lives easier.

Learn, engage, and get going with your organization’s needs!

[Join our Slack](https://slack.open-metadata.org/)

### Bi-Weekly Meetups
Join us on **alternate Wednesdays** over Zoom to learn about OpenMetadata’s progress. We are on a monthly release schedule. So every alternate meeting, we have a new release to showcase.

Come, join in, and share your feedback and questions.
