# Architecture

OpenMetadata Unlock the value of data assets with an end-to-end metadata platform that includes data discovery, governance, data quality, observability, and people collaboration.

OpenMetadata depends on following components to build a metadata platform:

- JsonSchemas for defining Metadata Schemas
- Dropwizard/Jetty for REST APIs
- MySQL 8.x to store Metadata
- ElasticSearch 7.x to index Metadata and power search
