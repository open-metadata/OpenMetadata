In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Redash connector.

Configure and schedule Redash metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Lineage](#lineage)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/dashboard/redash/troubleshooting)

{% partial file="/v1.9/connectors/ingestion-modes-tiles.md" variables={yamlPath: "/connectors/dashboard/redash/yaml"} /%}

## Requirements

We connect to Redash through the [API](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/integrations-and-api/api) endpoint, so the user
we use in the configuration to ingest data must have enough permissions to view all the data. For more info about the
permissions, please visit Redash documentation [here](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/users/permissions-groups).

## Metadata Ingestion
