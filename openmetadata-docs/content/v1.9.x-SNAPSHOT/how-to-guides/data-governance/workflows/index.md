# Governance Workflows


Governance Workflows in Collate enable teams to enforce organizational policies, ensure compliance and streamline collaborative processes.
As a **BETA** feature, Governance Workflows allows users to configure predefined workflows, with future updates planned to enable full creation and management capabilities.
Your feedback during this phase is invaluable to shape the feature's evolution.
