# Manage Teams and Users

OpenMetadataâ€™s versatile hierarchical team structure helps align with your organization's setup. Admins can mirror their organizational hierarchy by creating various team types. You can onboard new users to the relevant teams. An organization can have multiple Admins, so that different teams and departments can be effectively managed by separate Admins.
