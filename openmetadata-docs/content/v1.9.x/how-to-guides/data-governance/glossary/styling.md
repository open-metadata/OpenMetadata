# Glossary Styling

OpenMetadata supports glossary styling using colors and icons. Users can get a one-glance view of the related concepts and terms by color-coding the terms and by adding icons. When the glossary terms are color-coded and used for tagging the data assets, it is easier to differentiate and identify the data assets visually.

To stylize your glossary terms:
- Navigate to the **glossary term** to be edited.
- Click on the 3 dots icon **â‹®** and click on **style**

/%}

- Add a link to the **icon image**. You can also change the **font color**. Click on **Submit** to save the changes.

When data assets are tagged with the Glossary terms, the color-coding helps for easier identification of the required data assets.
