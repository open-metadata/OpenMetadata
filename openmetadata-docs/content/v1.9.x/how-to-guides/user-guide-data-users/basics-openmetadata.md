# Understanding the Basics of OpenMetadata

## Let’s Start with ‘My Data’ Page

Once you login to OpenMetadata, you can start exploring from the widget-rich ‘My Data’ page. My Data provides a single pane view of all your data assets, collaboration updates, data insights and more. This landing page comprises of widgets for Activity Feeds, Data Insights, Announcements, and other data asset related widgets.

## Activity Feed Widget

**Activity Feeds Widget** displays:
- **All:** All the activities related to the data assets that you own, follow, or where you are mentioned
- **@Mentions:** Feeds where you are mentioned
- **Tasks:** Tasks created by you, or assigned to you are displayed. Only the Open tasks are displayed here.

## My Data Widget

A quick glance at the **My Data Widget** will display all the data assets that you own. In case, you or your team does not own any data assets, you can start claiming the assets from the Explore page.
