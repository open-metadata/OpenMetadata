# OpenMetadata Server
Learn how to run the OpenMetadata server in development mode by using Docker and IntelliJ.

## Prerequisites
- For an easy installation of MySQL and ES, just install Docker on your local machine and run the following commands from the top-level directory

```shell
docker compose -f docker/development/docker-compose.yml up mysql elasticsearch --build -d
```

- For an easy installation of PostgreSQL and ES, just install Docker on your local machine and run the following commands from the top-level directory

```shell
docker compose -f docker/development/docker-compose-postgres.yml up postgresql opensearch --build -d
```

## Building
The following commands must be run from the top-level directory.

```shell
mvn clean install
```

If you wish to skip the unit tests you can do this by adding `-DskipTests` to the command line.

## Create a distribution (packaging)
You can create a distribution as follows.

```shell
$ mvn clean install
```

The binaries will be created at:

```shell
openmetadata-dist/target/open-metadata-<version>.pom
openmetadata-dist/target/open-metadata-<version>.tar.gz
```

## Bootstrap MySQL

Extract the distribution tar.gz file created on the previous step and run the following command

```shell
cd open-metadata-<version>
sh bootstrap/openmetadata-ops.sh drop-create
```
{%note%}
Why Needed: The script simplifies the setup and execution of OpenMetadata by handling Java dependencies, configurations, and environment variables automatically.

## Running the OpenMetadata server

You can run the OpenMetadata server directly

```shell
cd open-metadata-<version>
sh bin/openmetadata-server-start.sh conf/openmetadata.yaml
```
### Using IntelliJ IDEA
Add a new Run/Debug configuration like the below screenshot.

1. Click on Intellij - Run menu
2. Click on "Edit Configurations"
3. Click + sign and Select Application and make sure your config looks similar to the below image

{% image src="/images/v1.9/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-runtime-config.png" alt="Intellij Runtime Configuration" caption="Intellij Runtime Configuration" /%}

Note that if you want to test the connectors (Ingestion) while having the server running locally and the ingestion
running as a container, you will need to ensure that both components can properly talk to each other. To do so,
pass the following environment variable to IntelliJ when starting the server:

```bash
SERVER_HOST_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8585/api
```

#### Add missing dependency
Right-click on openmetadata-service

{% image src="/images/v1.9/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-openmetadata-service.png" alt="Open project" caption=" " /%}

Click on "Open Module Settings"

{% image src="/images/v1.9/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-open-settings.png" alt="Open Module Settings" caption=" " /%}

Go to "Dependencies"

{% image src="/images/v1.9/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-dependencies.png" alt="Go to dependencies" caption=" " /%}

Click “+” at the bottom of the dialog box and click "Add"

{% image src="/images/v1.9/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-add-dependencies.png" alt="Add dependency" caption=" " /%}

Click on Library

{% image src="/images/v1.9/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-library.png" alt="Click on Library" caption=" " /%}

In that list look for "jersey-client:2.25.1"

{% image src="/images/v1.9/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/intellij-jersey-dependency.png" alt="Add jersey-client dependency" caption=" " /%}

Select it and click "OK". 

We also need to set the folder ‘generated-resources’ in some module’s target folder as “source” folder. IntelliJ IDEA mark target folder as "excluded" by default, we could change it in the module setting. The openmetadata-spec and openmetadata-java-client modules have generated code, need to be changed.

Now run/debug the application.

## Load Sample Data into MySQL

With the OpenMetadata service up and running, run the following commands from the top-level directory

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install_dev generate
cd ingestion
pip install -e '.[sample-data, elasticsearch]'
metadata ingest -c ./pipelines/sample_data.json
metadata usage -c ./pipelines/sample_usage.json
```

- You are now ready to explore the app by going to [http://localhost:8585](http://localhost:8585) *If the web page doesn't work as intended, please take a look at the troubleshooting steps [here](/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/openmetadata-server#troubleshooting)

## Troubleshooting
- If you see blank page at [http://localhost:8585](http://localhost:8585), please check the logs at logs/openmetadata.log. You might be encountering one of the following errors:
  - `connection refused` or `unreachable` - please confirm that MySQL and ES are reachable outside of docker by running `docker ps` and checking that ports 3306 and 9200 are listening on 0.0.0.0
    - If ElasticSearch in Docker on Mac is crashing, try changing Preferences -> Resources -> Memory to 4GB
    - If ElasticSearch logs show `high disk watermark [90%] exceeded`, try changing Preferences -> Resources -> Disk Image Size to at least 16GB
  - `Public Key Retrieval is not allowed` - verify that the JDBC connect URL in `conf/openmetadata.yaml` is configured with the parameter `allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true `
  - Browser console shows javascript errors, try doing a [clean build](/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests/openmetadata-server#create-a-distribution-packaging). Some npm packages may not have been built properly.

## Coding Style
1. Configure IntelliJ to disable the [wild-card imports]
([https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#disable-wildcard-imports](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#disable-wildcard-imports))
