# IngestionPipeline

*Ingestion Pipeline Config is used to set up a DAG and deploy. This entity is used to setup metadata/quality pipelines on Apache Airflow.*

## Properties

- **`id`**: Unique identifier that identifies this pipeline. Refer to *[../../../type/basic.json#/definitions/uuid](#/../../type/basic.json#/definitions/uuid)*.
- **`name`**: Name that identifies this pipeline instance uniquely. Refer to *[../../../type/basic.json#/definitions/entityName](#/../../type/basic.json#/definitions/entityName)*.
- **`displayName`** *(string)*: Display Name that identifies this Pipeline.
- **`description`**: Description of the Pipeline. Refer to *[../../../type/basic.json#/definitions/markdown](#/../../type/basic.json#/definitions/markdown)*.
- **`pipelineType`**: Refer to *[#/definitions/pipelineType](#definitions/pipelineType)*.
- **`owners`**: Owners of this Pipeline. Refer to *[../../../type/entityReferenceList.json](#/../../type/entityReferenceList.json)*. Default: `null`.
- **`fullyQualifiedName`**: Name that uniquely identifies a Pipeline. Refer to *[../../../type/basic.json#/definitions/fullyQualifiedEntityName](#/../../type/basic.json#/definitions/fullyQualifiedEntityName)*.
- **`sourceConfig`**: Refer to *[../../../metadataIngestion/workflow.json#/definitions/sourceConfig](#/../../metadataIngestion/workflow.json#/definitions/sourceConfig)*.
- **`openMetadataServerConnection`**: Refer to *[../connections/metadata/openMetadataConnection.json](#/connections/metadata/openMetadataConnection.json)*.
- **`airflowConfig`**: Refer to *[#/definitions/airflowConfig](#definitions/airflowConfig)*.
- **`service`**: Link to the service (such as database, messaging, storage services, etc. for which this ingestion pipeline ingests the metadata from. Refer to *[../../../type/entityReference.json](#/../../type/entityReference.json)*.
- **`pipelineStatuses`**: Last of executions and status for the Pipeline. Refer to *[#/definitions/pipelineStatus](#definitions/pipelineStatus)*.
- **`loggerLevel`**: Set the logging level for the workflow. Refer to *[../../../metadataIngestion/workflow.json#/definitions/logLevels](#/../../metadataIngestion/workflow.json#/definitions/logLevels)*.
- **`deployed`** *(boolean)*: Indicates if the workflow has been successfully deployed to Airflow. Default: `false`.
- **`enabled`** *(boolean)*: True if the pipeline is ready to be run in the next schedule. False if it is paused. Default: `true`.
- **`href`**: Link to this ingestion pipeline resource. Refer to *[../../../type/basic.json#/definitions/href](#/../../type/basic.json#/definitions/href)*.
- **`version`**: Metadata version of the entity. Refer to *[../../../type/entityHistory.json#/definitions/entityVersion](#/../../type/entityHistory.json#/definitions/entityVersion)*.
- **`updatedAt`**: Last update time corresponding to the new version of the entity in Unix epoch time milliseconds. Refer to *[../../../type/basic.json#/definitions/timestamp](#/../../type/basic.json#/definitions/timestamp)*.
- **`updatedBy`** *(string)*: User who made the update.
- **`changeDescription`**: Change that led to this version of the entity. Refer to *[../../../type/entityHistory.json#/definitions/changeDescription](#/../../type/entityHistory.json#/definitions/changeDescription)*.
- **`deleted`** *(boolean)*: When `true` indicates the entity has been soft deleted. Default: `false`.
- **`provider`**: Refer to *[../../../type/basic.json#/definitions/providerType](#/../../type/basic.json#/definitions/providerType)*.
- **`domain`**: Domain the asset belongs to. When not set, the asset inherits the domain from the parent it belongs to. Refer to *[../../../type/entityReference.json](#/../../type/entityReference.json)*.
- **`applicationType`** *(string)*: Type of the application when pipelineType is 'application'.
