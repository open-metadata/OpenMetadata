# Viewing Activity Feeds and Managing Tasks

- Once logged in, the extension will display activity feeds from the **My Data** page, showing recent changes and updates related to your data assets.

- You can view the list of assigned tasks directly within the extension, keeping track of what needs to be done without switching to a different tool.
