# Upgrade from 0.11 to 0.12

Upgrading from 0.11 to 0.12 can be done directly on your instances. This page will list a couple of details that you should take into consideration when running the upgrade.

## Highlights

### Database Connection Environment Variables

On 0.11, the Environment Variables to connect to Database used were 
 1. MYSQL_USER 
 2. MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD 
 3. MYSQL_HOST 
 4. MYSQL_PORT 
 5. MYSQL_DATABASE. 
 
**These environment variables are changed in 0.12.0 Release**

1. DB_USER 
2. DB_USER_PASSWORD 
3. DB_HOST 
4. DB_PORT
5. OM_DATABASE. 

This will effect to all the **bare metal and docker instances** which configures a custom database depending on the above environment variable values.

This change is however not affected for Kubernetes deployments.

### Data Profiler and Data Quality Tests

On 0.11, the Profiler Workflow handled two things:
- Computing metrics on the data
- Running the configured Data Quality Tests

There has been a major overhaul where not only the UI greatly improved, now showing all historical data, but on the
internals as well. Main topics to consider:

1. Tests now run with the Test Suite workflow and cannot be configured in the Profiler Workflow
2. Any past test data will be cleaned up during the upgrade to 0.12.0, as the internal data storage has been improved
3. The Profiler Ingestion Pipelines will be cleaned up during the upgrade to 0.12.0 as well.

### DBT Tests Integration

From 0.12, OpenMetadata supports ingesting the tests and the test results from your DBT project.

- Along with `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files, We now provide an option to ingest the `run_results.json` file generated from the DBT run and ingest the test results from it.
- The field to enter the `run_results.json` file path is an optional field in the case of local and http DBT configs. The test results will be ingested from this file if it is provided.
- For others the file will be picked from their respective sources if it is available.

### Profiler Workflow Updates

On top of the information above, the `fqnFilterPattern` has been converted into the same patterns we use for ingestion,
`databaseFilterPattern`, `schemaFilterPattern` and `tableFilterPattern`.

In the `processor` you can now configure:
- `profileSample` to specify the % of the table to run the profiling on
- `columnConfig.profileQuery` as a query to use to sample the data of the table
- `columnConfig.excludeColumns` and `columnConfig.includeColumns` to mark which columns to skip.
  - In `columnConfig.includeColumns` we can also specify a list of `metrics` to run from our supported metrics.

### Profiler Multithreading for Snowflake users

In OpenMetadata 0.12 we have migrated the metrics computation to multithreading. This migration reduced metrics computation time by 70%. 

For Snowflake users, there is a known issue with the python package `snowflake-connector-python` in Python 3.9 where multithreading creates a circular import of the package. We highly recommend to either 1) run the ingestion workflow in Python 3.8 environment or 2) if you can't manage your environement set `ThreadCount` to 1. You can find more information on the profiler setting [here](/openmetadata/ingestion/workflows/profiler)

### Airflow Version

The Airflow version from the Ingestion container image has been upgraded to `2.3.3`.

Note that this means that now this is the version that will be used to run the Airflow metadata extraction. This impacted
for example when ingesting status from Airflow 2.1.4 (issue[https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/issues/7228]).

Moreover, the authentication mechanism that Airflow exposes for the custom plugins has changed. This required
us to fully update how we were handling the managed APIs, both on the plugin side and the OpenMetadata API (which is
the one sending the authentication).

To continue working with your own Airflow linked to the OpenMetadata UI for ingestion management, we recommend migrating
to Airflow 2.3.3.

If you are using your own Airflow to prepare the ingestion from the UI, which is stuck in version 2.1.4, and you cannot
upgrade that, but you want to use OM 0.12, reach out to us.

### Connector Improvements

- **Oracle**: In `0.11.x` and previous releases, we were using the [Cx_Oracle](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/) driver to extract the metadata from oracledb. The drawback of using this driver was it required Oracle Client libraries to be installed in the host machine in order to run the ingestion. With the `0.12` release, we will be using the [python-oracledb](https://oracle.github.io/python-oracledb/) driver which is a upgraded version of `Cx_Oracle`. `python-oracledb` with `Thin` mode does not need Oracle Client libraries.


- **Azure SQL & MSSQL**: Azure SQL & MSSQL with pyodbc scheme requires ODBC driver to be installed, with `0.12` release we are shipping the `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server` out of the box in our ingestion docker image.

### Service Connection Updates

- DynamoDB
  - Removed: `database`
- Deltalake:
  - Removed: `connectionOptions` and `supportsProfiler`
- Looker
  - Renamed `username` to `clientId` and `password` to `clientSecret` to align on the internals required for the metadata extraction.
  - Removed: `env`
- Oracle
  - Removed: `databaseSchema` and `oracleServiceName` from the root.
  - Added: `oracleConnectionType` which will either contain `oracleServiceName` or `databaseSchema`. This will reduce confusion on setting up the connection.
- Athena
  - Removed: `hostPort`
- Databricks
  - Removed: `username` and `password`
- DBT Config
  - Added: `dbtRunResultsFilePath` and `dbtRunResultsHttpPath` where path of the `run_results.json` file can be passed to get the test results data from DBT.

In 0.12.1

- DeltaLake:
  - Updated the structure of the connection to better reflect the possible options.
    - Removed `metastoreHostPort` and `metastoreFilePath`, which are now embedded inside `metastoreConnection`
    - Added `metastoreDb` as an option to be passed inside `metastoreConnection`
  - You can find more information about the current structure [here](/openmetadata/connectors/database/deltalake/cli#1-define-the-yaml-config)

### Ingestion from CLI 

We have stopped updating the service connection parameters when running the ingestion workflow from the CLI.
The connection parameter will be retrieved from the server if the service already exists.
Therefore, the connection parameters of a service will only be possible to be updated from the OpenMetadata UI.
