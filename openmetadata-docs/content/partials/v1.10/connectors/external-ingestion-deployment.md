## How to Run the Connector Externally

To run the Ingestion via the UI you'll need to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion Container, which comes shipped with
custom Airflow plugins to handle the workflow deployment.

If, instead, you want to manage your workflows externally on your preferred orchestrator, you can check
the following docs to run the Ingestion Framework **anywhere**.

{% tilesContainer %}
  {% tile
    title="External Schedulers"
    description="Get more information about running the Ingestion Framework Externally"
    link="/deployment/ingestion"
  / %}
{% /tilesContainer %}
