**Advanced Configuration**

Database Services have an Advanced Configuration section, where you can pass extra arguments to the connector
and, if needed, change the connection Scheme.

This would only be required to handle advanced connectivity scenarios or customizations.

- **Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
- **Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
