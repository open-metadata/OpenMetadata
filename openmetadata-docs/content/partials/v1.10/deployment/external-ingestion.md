This page is about running the Ingestion Framework **externally**!

There are mainly 2 ways of running the ingestion:
1. Internally, by managing the workflows from OpenMetadata.
2. Externally, by using any other tool capable of running Python code.

If you are looking for how to manage the ingestion process from OpenMetadata, you can follow
this [doc](/deployment/ingestion/openmetadata).
