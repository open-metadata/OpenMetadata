Once your server security is set, it's time to review the ingestion configuration. Our bots support JWT tokens

Find more information on [**Enabling JWT Tokens**](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens) and [**JWT Troubleshooting**](/deployment/security/jwt-troubleshooting) to ensure seamless authentication.
