# Quick Start Guide for Admins

Admin users have access to manage all the data assets. They can manage all the functions to create, edit, or delete. Admins can manage Roles, Policies, Services, Notifications, Custom Properties, Data Insights and more. They can add other users, or create teams to onboard users. An organization can have multiple Admins so that separate Admins can effectively manage different teams and departments.
