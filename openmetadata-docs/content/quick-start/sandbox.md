# OpenMetadata Sandbox

We want our users to get the experience of OpenMetadata with the least effort 😁. That is why we have set up a 
[sandbox](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/) that mimics a real production setup. Please take it for a spin and 
let us know your feedback on [Slack](https://slack.open-metadata.org/).

## To set up your sandbox account
