# How Collate AI Enhances Autopilot Workflows

Collate AI seamlessly integrates with the Autopilot application in Collate to automate and enhance metadata management processes. This integration streamlines the onboarding of new data services and enriches metadata through AI-driven automation.

## How Collate AI Integrates with Autopilot

### Automated Metadata Ingestion with Autopilot

When a new data service is added, Autopilot automatically initiates agents that manage ingestion workflows. These workflows extract:

- Schemas  
- Lineage  
- Usage  
- Profiling information  

This forms the foundation for further AI-driven enhancements.

### AI Agents Enhancing Metadata

Post-ingestion, Collate AI deploys specialized agents to enrich metadata:

- **Documentation Agent**  
  Generates descriptive metadata for tables and columns, improving understanding and discoverability.

- **Tiering Agent**  
  Analyzes data usage and lineage to assign business-criticality tiers to data assets.

- **Data Quality Agent**  
  Creates data quality tests based on table constraints and patterns, ensuring reliability.

## Insights and Monitoring

The outcomes of these processes are available in the **Service Insights dashboard**, offering key performance indicators such as:

- Percentage of assets with generated descriptions
- Distribution of data assets across different tiers
- Data quality health metrics
- Identification of assets containing PII

## Benefits of the Integration

- **Efficiency**  
  Reduces manual effort in metadata documentation and quality assurance.

- **Consistency**  
  Ensures uniform metadata standards across the organization.

- **Visibility**  
  Provides clear insights into data assets, aiding governance and compliance.
