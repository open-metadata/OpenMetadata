# Custom OIDC SSO

Follow the sections in this guide to set up Custom OIDC SSO.

{% note %}

Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth)
  enabled before configuring the authentication with Custom OIDC SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens). The keys we provide
  by default are aimed only for quickstart and testing purposes. They should NEVER be used in a production installation.

{% /note %}

## Create Server Credentials

- Go to the console of your preferred custom OIDC SSO provider
- Create an OIDC client application with implicit flow enabled to get a client ID.

### Create Client ID and Secret Key

- Navigate to your preferred OIDC provider console and create an OIDC client application.
- Generate client ID and secret key in JSON format.

After the applying these steps, you can update the configuration of your deployment:

{% inlineCalloutContainer %}
  {% inlineCallout
    color="violet-70"
    icon="celebration"
    bold="Docker Security"
    href="/deployment/security/custom-oidc/docker" %}
    Configure Custom OIDC SSO for your Docker Deployment.
  {% /inlineCallout %}
  {% inlineCallout
    color="violet-70"
    icon="storage"
    bold="Bare Metal Security"
    href="/deployment/security/custom-oidc/bare-metal" %}
    Configure Custom OIDC SSO for your Bare Metal Deployment.
  {% /inlineCallout %}
  {% inlineCallout
    color="violet-70"
    icon="fit_screen"
    bold="Kubernetes Security"
    href="/deployment/security/custom-oidc/kubernetes" %}
    Configure Custom OIDC SSO for your Kubernetes Deployment.
  {% /inlineCallout %}
{% /inlineCalloutContainer %}
