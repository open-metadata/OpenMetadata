Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth)
  enabled before configuring the authentication with Amazon Cognito SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens) in case it is
  enabled.

- In the same step, select "Public client" for the Initial App client type and configure the Allowed callback URLs
  with `https://{your-collate-domain}/callback` as shown in the screenshot below. Note: For production deployments, the Allowed
  callback URLs should be updated with the appropriate domain name.

- The last step is to Review and create the User Pool.

- The `User Pool ID` can be found in the User Pool summary page as seen in the screenshot below

- The App client ID can be found under the "App Integration" tab of the User Pool page. There will be a section that
  lists all the App clients with client name and client ID as shown below
