# Getting Started

Welcome to Collate's unified platform for data discovery, observability, and governance! Our platform centralizes all 
the context around your data to help you build high-quality data and AI assets. This guide gives you all the information you
need to set up your Collate environment in 30 minutes.

## How Does Collate Work?

Collate is designed for both technical and non-technical data practitioners to work together across a broad set of use cases,
including data discovery, lineage, observability, quality, collaboration, governance, and insights.

A library of 90+ turnkey connectors is available to easily ingest metadata into Collate, such as data warehouses, data lakes,
streaming, dashboards, ML models, and more. APIs are also available to easily ingest metadata from custom data sources. 
Metadata from these different sources is organized into a Unified Metadata Graph, which provides a single, comprehensive 
source of truth across your entire data estate. 

This centralized information is surfaced through a unified user interface for all your use cases so that different data
practitioners no longer need to switch between different data catalogs, quality, or governance tools. Additionally, 
Collate can be extended through the application ecosystem, such as with AI productivity applications like Collate AI, 
or with customer-built workflows to integrate Collate with your existing systems. These capabilities are built around 
native collaboration capabilities for shared workflows across different teams so that every data practitioner can work 
together: data platform, data governance, data scientist/analyst, and business user.
