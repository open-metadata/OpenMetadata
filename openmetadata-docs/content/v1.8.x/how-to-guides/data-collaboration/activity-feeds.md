# Understanding Activity Feeds

The **Activity Feeds** in OpenMetadata displays all the activities around the data you own and the data you follow. Activity Feeds are great conversation starters to collaborate with your team. Click on the OpenMetadata icon to access the landing page with the activity feeds.

- **@Mentions:** Feeds where you are mentioned
- **Tasks:** Tasks created by you, or assigned to you are displayed. Only the Open tasks are displayed here.
