# Collate: Entity Relationship (ER) Diagrams

## Overview

Entity Relationship (ER) Diagrams in Collate provide a visual representation of how tables are connected within a database. These diagrams offer a complete picture of your data structure by automatically detecting relationships based on constraints such as **primary keys** and **foreign keys** during metadata ingestion.

## Automatic Detection of Relationships

Collate's [**metadata ingestion workflow**](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/metadata) identifies and extracts table relationships, ensuring that **primary key** and **foreign key** constraints are accurately represented. Once ingestion is completed, users can access ER diagrams at both the **table level** and **database schema level**.  

## Features of ER Diagrams  

### Visualizing Table Relationships

- ER diagrams display **tables, constraints, and relationships** between them.  
- **Relationship cardinality** is clearly indicated, helping users understand data connections.

### Interactive Exploration

- Users can navigate from table to table by following relationships.  
- Enhances **data discovery** by making it more intuitive and efficient.  

### Editing Relationships

- Modify existing relationships by **updating their type**.  
- **Add or remove** relationships to reflect changes in the database structure.  

### Table View for Simplified Insights

- In addition to the diagram, Collate offers a **table view** listing all relationships in a structured format.  
- Provides a **quick overview** of data dependencies.

## Benefits of ER Diagrams  

### Improved Database Understanding

- ER diagrams create a **common language** for database discussions.
- Helps teams **visualize complex relationships** and constraints.  

### Enhanced Troubleshooting & Impact Analysis

- Users can quickly **identify table relationships** and assess the impact of schema changes.  
- Assists in **debugging and optimizing database structures**.  

With **Collate's ER Diagrams**, users gain **greater visibility** into their data relationships, improving **data discovery, governance, and analysis**.
