4. Upload/Drop the Database Service CSV file that you want to import. Alternatively, you can `export` an existing Database Service CSV as a template, make the necessary edits, and then upload the updated file.

Once you have the template, you can fill in the following details:

- **name** (required): This field contains the name of the database.

- **fullyQualifiedName** (required): This field contains the fully qualified name of the database service.

- **displayName**: This field holds the display name of the database.

- **description**: This field contains a detailed description or information about the database.

- **owner**: This field specifies the owner of the database.
