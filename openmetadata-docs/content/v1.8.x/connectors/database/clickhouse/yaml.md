## Requirements


Clickhouse user must grant `SELECT` privilege on `system.*` and schema/tables to fetch the metadata of tables and views.

* Create a new user
* More details https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user

```sql
CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY <password>
```

* Grant Permissions
* More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant

```sql
-- Grant SELECT and SHOW to that user
-- More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant
GRANT SELECT, SHOW ON system.* to <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON <schema_name>.* to <username>;
```

### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/workflow) and data quality tests [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality).

### Usage & Lineage
For the usage and lineage workflow, the user will need `SELECT` privilege. You can find more information on the usage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage) and the lineage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage).

### Python Requirements

{% partial file="/v1.8/connectors/python-requirements.md" /%}

To run the Clickhouse ingestion, you will need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[clickhouse]"
```

If you want to run the Usage Connector, you'll also need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[clickhouse-usage]"
```

## Metadata Ingestion

All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/clickhouseConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Clickhouse.

In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.

The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)

### 1. Define the YAML Config

This is a sample config for Clickhouse:

{% codePreview %}

{% codeInfoContainer %}

#### Source Configuration - Service Connection

{% codeInfo srNumber=1 %}

**username**: Specify the User to connect to Clickhouse. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=2 %}

**password**: Password to connect to Clickhouse.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=3 %}

**hostPort**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Clickhouse deployment in the Host and Port field.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=4 %}

**databaseSchema**: databaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=5 %}

**duration**: The duration of a SQL connection in ClickHouse depends on the configuration of the connection and the workload being processed. Connections are kept open for as long as needed to complete a query, but they can also be closed based on duration set.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=6 %}

**scheme**: There are 2 types of schemes that the user can choose from.

- **clickhouse+http**: Uses ClickHouse's HTTP interface for communication. Widely supported, but slower than native.
- **clickhouse+native**: Uses the native ClickHouse TCP protocol for communication. Faster than http, but may require additional server-side configuration. Recommended for performance-critical applications.


{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=35 %}

**https**: Enable this flag when the when the Clickhouse instance is hosted via HTTPS protocol. This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+http` connection scheme.

{% /codeInfo %}


{% codeInfo srNumber=36 %}

**secure**: Establish secure connection with ClickHouse. ClickHouse supports secure communication over SSL/TLS to protect data in transit, by checking this option, it establishes secure connection with ClickHouse. This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+native` connection scheme.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=37 %}

**keyfile**: The key file path is the location when ClickHouse looks for a file containing the private key needed for secure communication over SSL/TLS. By default, ClickHouse will look for the key file in the `/etc/clickhouse-server directory`, with the file name `server.key`. However, this can be customized in the ClickHouse configuration file (`config.xml`). This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+native` connection scheme and the secure connection flag is enabled.

#### Advanced Configuration

{% codeInfo srNumber=7 %}

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=8 %}

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`
