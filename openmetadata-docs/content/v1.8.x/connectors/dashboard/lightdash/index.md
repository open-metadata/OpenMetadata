#### Connection Details


- **Host and Port**: Specify the network location where your Lightdash instance is accessible, combining both hostname and port in a URI format: either `http://hostname:port` or `https://hostname:port`, based on your security needs.

   - **Example**: For a local setup, use `http://localhost:8080`; for a server deployment, it might be `https://lightdash.example.com:3000`.
   - Ensure the specified port is open and accessible through network firewall settings.

- **API Key**: This key authenticates requests to your Lightdash instance. Keep the API Key secure, sharing it only with authorized applications or users.

- **Project UUID**: This unique identifier links API requests or configurations to a specific project in Lightdash. 

- **Space UUID**: Identifies a specific "Space" in Lightdash, used to organize dashboards, charts, and assets.

- **Proxy Authentication**: If your Lightdash instance requires authentication through a proxy server, provide proxy credentials. Proxy authentication controls access to external resources and Lightdash.
