# How to Change the Team Type

Refer to the [**Team Structure in OpenMetadata**](/how-to-guides/admin-guide/teams-and-users/team-structure-openmetadata) to get a clear understanding of the various **Team Types**.

Let's say you have a team `Digital_Marketing` of the type **`Department`** and you want to change it to the type **`Division`**. You can easily change that through the UI.

**1.** Navigate to **Settings >> Team & User Management >> Teams**. Click on the `Digital_Marketing` team name to view the details.
