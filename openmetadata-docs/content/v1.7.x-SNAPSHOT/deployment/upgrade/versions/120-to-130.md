# Upgrade from 1.2.x to 1.3.x

Upgrading from 1.2.x to 1.3.x can be done directly on your instances. This page will list few general details you should take into consideration when running the upgrade.

## Deprecation Notice


## Breaking Changes for 1.3.x Stable Release


## Service Connection Changes

### Airflow Connection

Removed the `MSSQL` connection option from airflow backend database. This is due to the option being experimental and will be deprecated by the Airflow team. For more information refer to the [link](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/set-up-database.html#choosing-database-backend).

If you are using airflow with `MSSQL` backend, we recommend switching it to the supported backends e.g `MYSQL` or `POSTGRES`.

#### Removed below MSSQL config option from Airflow

```yaml
...
  connection:
    type: Mssql
    username: user
    password: pass
    hostPort: localhost:1433
    database: dev
```
