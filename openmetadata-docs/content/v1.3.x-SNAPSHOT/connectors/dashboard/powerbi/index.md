## Requirements

To access the PowerBI APIs and import dashboards, charts, and datasets from PowerBI into OpenMetadata, a `PowerBI Pro` license is necessary.

### PowerBI Account Setup

### Step 1: Create an Azure AD app and configure the PowerBI Admin consle

Please follow the steps mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/embed-service-principal) for setting up the Azure AD application service principle and configure PowerBI admin settings

Login to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/) as Admin and from `Tenant` settings allow below permissions.
- Allow service principles to use Power BI APIs
- Allow service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs
- Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata

### Step 2: Provide necessary API permissions to the app
Go to the `Azure Ad app registrations` page, select your app and add the dashboard permissions to the app for PowerBI service and grant admin consent for the same:

The required permissions are:
- `Dashboard.Read.All`

Optional Permissions: (Without granting these permissions, the dataset information cannot be retrieved and the datamodel and lineage processing will be skipped)
- `Dataset.Read.All`

{% note %}

Make sure that in the API permissions section **Tenant** related permissions are not being given to the app
Please refer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71001110/power-bi-rest-api-requests-not-authorizing-as-expected) for detailed explanation 

{% /note %}

### Step 3: Create New PowerBI workspace
The service principal only works with [new workspaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces).

#### Connection Details

**clientId**: PowerBI Client ID.

To get the client ID (also known as application ID), follow these steps:
- Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).
- Search for App registrations and select the App registrations link.
- Select the Azure AD app you're using for embedding your Power BI content.
- From the Overview section, copy the Application (client) ID.

**clientSecret**: PowerBI Client Secret.

To get the client secret, follow these steps:
- Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).
- Search for App registrations and select the App registrations link.
- Select the Azure AD app you're using for embedding your Power BI content.
- Under Manage, select Certificates & secrets.
- Under Client secrets, select New client secret.
- In the Add a client secret pop-up window, provide a description for your application secret, select when the application secret expires, and select Add.
- From the Client secrets section, copy the string in the Value column of the newly created application secret.

**tenantId**: PowerBI Tenant ID.

To get the tenant ID, follow these steps:
- Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).
- Search for App registrations and select the App registrations link.
- Select the Azure AD app you're using for Power BI.
- From the Overview section, copy the Directory (tenant) ID.

**scope**: Service scope.

To let OM use the Power BI APIs using your Azure AD app, you'll need to add the following scopes:
- https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default

Instructions for adding these scopes to your app can be found by following this link: https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default.

**authorityUri**: Authority URI for the service.

To identify a token authority, you can provide a URL that points to the authority in question.

If you don't specify a URL for the token authority, we'll use the default value of https://login.microsoftonline.com/.

**hostPort**: URL to the PowerBI instance.

To connect with your Power BI instance, you'll need to provide the host URL. If you're using an on-premise installation of Power BI, this will be the domain name associated with your instance.

If you don't specify a host URL, we'll use the default value of https://app.powerbi.com to connect with your Power BI instance.

**Pagination Entity Per Page**:

The pagination limit for Power BI APIs can be set using this parameter. The limit determines the number of records to be displayed per page.

By default, the pagination limit is set to 100 records, which is also the maximum value allowed.

**Use Admin APIs**:

Option for using the PowerBI admin APIs:
- Enabled (Use PowerBI Admin APIs)
Using the admin APIs will fetch the dashboard and chart metadata from all the workspaces available in the PowerBI instance.

{% note %} 

When using the PowerBI Admin APIs there are no limitations on the Datasets that are retrieved for creating lineage information.

{% /note %}

- Disabled (Use Non-Admin PowerBI APIs)
Using the non-admin APIs will only fetch the dashboard and chart metadata from the workspaces that have the security group of the service principal assigned to them.

{% note %} 

When using the PowerBI Non-Admin APIs, the lineage information can only be generated if the dataset is a [Push Dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/push-datasets).
For more information please visit the PowerBI official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/push-datasets/datasets-get-tables#limitations).
