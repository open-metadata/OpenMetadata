# How to Customize OpenMetadata

Personalize your Open Metadata experience to reflect your company’s unique identity. Follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Preferences**.
2. Click on **Theme**.

Open Metadata previously supported uploading your company logo, monogram, and favicon to customize the platform’s appearance according to your brand identity. Now, you can take it a step further by customizing the theme with colors that perfectly align with your company’s branding. Changing the primary color will dynamically adjust the appearance of buttons, navigation panes, data assets, tab headers, and more. The selected color for info reflects on the selected data assets.

If you ever want to revert to the original theme, you can do so with a simple click. Explore the possibilities to customize Open Metadata to shape your digital workspace
