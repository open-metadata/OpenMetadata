# How to Add Assets to Glossary Terms

After creating a glossary term, data assets can be associated with the term. In the **Glossary Term > Assets Tab** all the assets associated with the glossary term are displayed. These data assets are further subgrouped as Tables, Topics, Dashboards, etc.

You can add more assets by clicking on **Add > Assets**.

You can further search and filter assets by type. Simply select the relevant assets and click **Save**.

The glossary term lists the Assets, which makes it easy to discover all the data assets related to the term.

## Glossary Terms and Tags

If **Tags** are associated with a **Glossary Term**, then applying that glossary term to a data asset, will also automatically apply the associated tags to that data asset. For example, the glossary term ‘Account’ has a PII.Sensitive tag associated with it. When you add a glossary term to a data asset, the associated tags also get added.
