# Entity Lineage

*The `Lineage` for a given data asset, has information of the input datasets used and the ETL pipeline that created it.*

## Properties

- **`entity`**: Primary entity for which this lineage graph is created. Refer to *entityReference.json*.
- **`nodes`** *(array)*: Default: `None`.
  - **Items**: Refer to *entityReference.json*.
- **`upstreamEdges`** *(array)*: Default: `None`.
  - **Items**: Refer to *#/definitions/edge*.
- **`downstreamEdges`** *(array)*: Default: `None`.
  - **Items**: Refer to *#/definitions/edge*.
## Definitions

- **`columnLineage`** *(object)*
  - **`fromColumns`** *(array)*: One or more source columns identified by fully qualified column name used by transformation function to create destination column.
    - **Items**: Refer to *../type/basic.json#/definitions/fullyQualifiedEntityName*.
  - **`toColumn`**: Destination column identified by fully qualified column name created by the transformation of source columns. Refer to *../type/basic.json#/definitions/fullyQualifiedEntityName*.
  - **`function`**: Transformation function applied to source columns to create destination column. That is `function(fromColumns) -> toColumn`. Refer to *../type/basic.json#/definitions/sqlFunction*.
- **`lineageDetails`** *(object)*: Lineage details including sqlQuery + pipeline + columnLineage.
  - **`sqlQuery`**: SQL used for transformation. Refer to *../type/basic.json#/definitions/sqlQuery*.
  - **`columnsLineage`** *(array)*: Lineage information of how upstream columns were combined to get downstream column.
    - **Items**: Refer to *#/definitions/columnLineage*.
  - **`pipeline`**: Pipeline where the sqlQuery is periodically run. Refer to *../type/entityReference.json*.
  - **`description`** *(string)*: description of lineage.
  - **`source`** *(string)*: Lineage type describes how a lineage was created. Must be one of: `['Manual', 'ViewLineage', 'QueryLineage', 'PipelineLineage', 'DashboardLineage', 'DbtLineage', 'SparkLineage', 'OpenLineage', 'ExternalTableLineage', 'CrossDatabaseLineage', 'ChildAssets']`. Default: `Manual`.
  - **`createdAt`**: Last update time corresponding to the new version of the entity in Unix epoch time milliseconds. Refer to *../type/basic.json#/definitions/timestamp*.
  - **`createdBy`** *(string)*: User who created the node.
  - **`updatedAt`**: Last update time corresponding to the new version of the entity in Unix epoch time milliseconds. Refer to *../type/basic.json#/definitions/timestamp*.
  - **`updatedBy`** *(string)*: User who made the update.
  - **`assetEdges`** *(integer)*: Asset count in case of child assets lineage. Default: `None`.
- **`edge`** *(object)*: Edge in the lineage graph from one entity to another by entity IDs. Cannot contain additional properties.
  - **`fromEntity`**: From entity that is upstream of lineage edge. Refer to *basic.json#/definitions/uuid*.
  - **`toEntity`**: To entity that is downstream of lineage edge. Refer to *basic.json#/definitions/uuid*.
  - **`description`**: Refer to *basic.json#/definitions/markdown*.
  - **`lineageDetails`**: Optional lineageDetails provided only for table to table lineage edge. Refer to *#/definitions/lineageDetails*.
- **`entitiesEdge`** *(object)*: Edge in the lineage graph from one entity to another using entity references. Cannot contain additional properties.
  - **`fromEntity`**: From entity that is upstream of lineage edge. Refer to *entityReference.json*.
  - **`toEntity`**: To entity that is downstream of lineage edge. Refer to *entityReference.json*.
  - **`description`**: Refer to *basic.json#/definitions/markdown*.
  - **`lineageDetails`**: Optional lineageDetails provided only for table to table lineage edge. Refer to *#/definitions/lineageDetails*.
