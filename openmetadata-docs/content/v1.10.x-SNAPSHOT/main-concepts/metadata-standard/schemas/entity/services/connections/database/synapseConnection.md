- **`hostPort`** *(string)*: Host and port of the Azure Synapse service.
- **`database`** *(string)*: Database of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single database. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databases.
