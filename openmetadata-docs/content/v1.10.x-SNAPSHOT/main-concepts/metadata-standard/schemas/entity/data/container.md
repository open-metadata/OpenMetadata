# Container

*This schema defines the Container entity. A Container is an abstraction for any path(including the top level eg. bucket in S3) storing data in an Object store such as S3, GCP, Azure. It maps a tree-like structure, where each Container can have a parent and a list of sub-folders, and it can be structured - where it contains structured data, or unstructured where no schema for its data is defined.*

## Properties
