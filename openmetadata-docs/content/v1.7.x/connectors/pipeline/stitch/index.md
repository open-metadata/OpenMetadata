In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Stitch connector.

Configure and schedule Stitch metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/pipeline/stitch/troubleshooting)

## Requirements

To extract metadata from Stitch, User first need to crate API crednetials:
- `Token`: Token to access Stitch metadata.


## Metadata Ingestion

{% partial 
    file="/v1.7/connectors/metadata-ingestion-ui.md" 
    variables={
        connector: "Stitch", 
        selectServicePath: "/images/v1.7/connectors/stitch/select-service.png",
        addNewServicePath: "/images/v1.7/connectors/stitch/add-new-service.png",
        serviceConnectionPath: "/images/v1.7/connectors/stitch/service-connection.png",
    } 
/%}
