## Requirements

{% note %}
We only support officially supported Airflow versions. 
You can check the version list [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/supported-versions.html).

#### Connection Details

- **Host and Port**: URL to the Airflow instance.
- **Number of Status**: Number of status we want to look back to in every ingestion (e.g., Past executions from a DAG).
- **Connection**: Airflow metadata database connection. See these [docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/set-up-database.html)
  for supported backends.

In terms of `connection` we support the following selections:

- `backend`: Should not be used from the UI. This is only applicable when ingesting Airflow metadata locally
    by running the ingestion from a DAG. It will use the current Airflow SQLAlchemy connection to extract the data.
- `MySQL`, `Postgres`, and `SQLite`: Pass the required credentials to reach out each of these services. We
    will create a connection to the pointed database and read Airflow data from there.
