{% partial file="/v1.7/connectors/ingestion-modes-tiles.md" variables={yamlPath: "/connectors/dashboard/mode/yaml"} /%}

## Requirements

OpenMetadata relies on Mode's API, which is exclusive to members of the Mode Business Workspace. This means that only resources that belong to a Mode Business Workspace can be accessed via the API.

## Metadata Ingestion

{% partial 
  file="/v1.7/connectors/metadata-ingestion-ui.md" 
  variables={
    connector: "Mode", 
    selectServicePath: "/images/v1.7/connectors/mode/select-service.png",
    addNewServicePath: "/images/v1.7/connectors/mode/add-new-service.png",
    serviceConnectionPath: "/images/v1.7/connectors/mode/service-connection.png",
}
