{% note %}
As per the [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/tags.html#manage-tags-with-sql-commands) here, note that we only support metadata `tag` extraction for databricks version 13.3 version and higher.
{% /note %}


In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Databricks connector.

Configure and schedule Databricks metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

## Requirements

### Python Requirements

{% partial file="/v1.8/connectors/python-requirements.md" /%}

To run the Databricks ingestion, you will need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[databricks]"
```

### Permission Requirement

To enable full functionality of metadata extraction, profiling, usage, and lineage features in OpenMetadata, the following permissions must be granted to the relevant users in your Databricks environment.

### Metadata and Profiling Permissions

These permissions are required on the catalogs, schemas, and tables from which metadata and profiling information will be ingested.

```sql
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG <catalog_name> TO `<user>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO `<user>`;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE <table_name> TO `<user>`;
```

Ensure these grants are applied to all relevant tables for metadata ingestion and profiling operations.

### Usage and Lineage

These permissions enable OpenMetadata to extract query history and construct lineage information.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON SYSTEM.QUERY.HISTORY TO `<user>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system.query TO `<user>`;
```

These permissions allow access to Databricks system tables that track query activity, enabling lineage and usage statistics generation.

{% note %}

Adjust <user>, <catalog_name>, <schema_name>, and <table_name> according to your specific deployment and security requirements.

## Unity Catalog

If you are using unity catalog in Databricks, then checkout the [Unity Catalog](/connectors/database/unity-catalog) connector.

## Metadata Ingestion

#### Connection Details

- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Databricks deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Token**: Generated Token to connect to Databricks.
- **HTTP Path**: Databricks compute resources URL.
- **connectionTimeout**: The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a successful connection to the data source. If the connection attempt takes longer than this timeout period, an error will be returned.
- **Catalog**: Catalog of the data source(Example: hive_metastore). This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single catalog. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the catalog.
- **DatabaseSchema**: databaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.
