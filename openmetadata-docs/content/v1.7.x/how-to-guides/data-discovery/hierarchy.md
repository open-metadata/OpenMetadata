# Steps for Searching Using Hierarchy

## Access the Hierarchy View:
- Navigate to the **Hierarchy View** within the OpenMetadata interface, where data is organized in a structured, layered manner.
- This view displays data assets and entities arranged based on their relationships and dependencies.

## Navigating the Hierarchical Structure:
- Expand or collapse different levels of the hierarchy to drill down into more specific data assets or to view higher-level parent assets.
- Click on a data asset within the hierarchy to view detailed information, metadata, or related data connections.
