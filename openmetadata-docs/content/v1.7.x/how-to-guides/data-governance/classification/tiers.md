# What are Tiers

Tiering is an important concept of data classification in OpenMetadata. Tiers should be based on the importance of data. Using Tiers, data producers or owners can define the importance of data to an organization.

In OpenMetadata, Tiers are System Classification tags and can be accessed from **Govern > Classification > Tier**.

In case of tiering, it is easiest to start with the most important (Tier 1) and the least important (Tier 5) data. Once the **Tier 1** or most important data is identified, organizations can focus on improving the descriptions and data quality. The Data Insights in OpenMetadata helps identify the unused datasets as **Tier 5**. The Tier 5 datasets can be deleted periodically to declutter. Other tiers can be added as per your organizational needs. **Tags** can be added to further mark the data assets.

| **Tier** | **Impact** | **Used for** | **Type of Impact** | **Usage** |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tier 1** | High | External & Internal Decisions | Revenue, Regulatory, & Reputational | Highly used |
| **Tier 2** | Moderate | Some External & Mostly Internal Decisions | Some Regulatory | Highly used |
| **Tier 3** | Low | Internal Decisions | - | Highly used (Top N percentile) |
| **Tier 4** | Low | Internal Team Decisions | - | - |
| **Tier 5** | Individual owned | Unused Datasets | - | - |

## How to Add Tiers

From the **Explore** page, select a data asset and click on the edit icon for **Tier**. Select the appropriate tier. Clicking on the arrow next to the tier will provide a description of the tier.
