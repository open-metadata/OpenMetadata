# Governance Workflows - Dashboard Certification Workflow (Default)

The **Dashboard Certification Workflow** in Collate is a scheduled, rule-based automation designed to evaluate and assign certification levels—**Gold**, **Silver**, **Bronze**, or **None**—to dashboards based on specific metadata attributes. This workflow helps promote trusted, well-documented dashboards across the organization.

## Overview

The certification process runs periodically according to a defined schedule. It identifies qualifying dashboards based on predefined rules and automatically updates their certification status. This enables users to quickly identify high-quality, well-managed dashboards.

## Workflow Logic

The **Dashboard Certification Workflow** consists of the following evaluation steps:

### 1. Owners and Description Check

**Condition**:  
The dashboard must have both a non-null, non-empty **Owner** and **Description**.

**Outcome**:
- If either attribute is missing or empty → **Set No Certification**
- Otherwise → Proceed to **Tier Evaluation**

### 2. Tier Evaluation

**Condition**:  
The workflow checks the value of the **Tier** tag applied to the dashboard.

**Outcome**:
- If **Tier 1** or **Tier 2** → Proceed to **Tier Identification**
- If neither → **Set Bronze Certification**

### 3. Tier Identification

**Condition**:  
Determine whether the dashboard is **Tier 1** or **Tier 2**.

**Outcome**:
- If **Tier 1** → **Set Gold Certification**
- If **Tier 2** → **Set Silver Certification**

## Certification Levels

| Certification Level | Criteria                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gold**            | Dashboard has an owner, a description, and is tagged as **Tier 1**       |
| **Silver**          | Dashboard has an owner, a description, and is tagged as **Tier 2**       |
| **Bronze**          | Dashboard has an owner and a description but no Tier 1/2 classification  |
| **None**            | Dashboard lacks either an owner or a description                         |
