# Governance Workflows - Create User Task

The **Create User Task** node is used to define a task that requires a designated user (or team) to complete.
This is essential to allow user input within the workflow.

**As of now, this node is focused on the Glossary Approval Task. It will be updated to enable more tasks in the next releases.**

## Configuration

After you define a **Display Name** and a **Description** for this node, you can define the assignees for the task.

**As of now, the assignees will be the Reviewers for the Glossary Term**

## Example

We can see an example of this node's configuration below:
