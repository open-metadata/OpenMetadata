# Glossary Approval Workflow

The business glossary plays a vital role in standardizing terminology in an organization. The Glossary Approval Workflow provides control where every term added to a business glossary has been reviewed and approved by the reviewers of the glossary. This helps avoid duplicate terms, incomplete definitions, and obsolete terminologies.

To automate the approval workflow, ensure that your Glossary has **Reviewers** assigned. If you glossary has reviewers assigned, the glossary approval workflow gets triggered when a **New Term** is added.

- The new term will show up in the Glossary, but will be marked as **Draft**. 
- Only the assigned **Reviewers** can Approve or Reject the term.
- A **Task** is assigned for the Reviewers.
- The details of the glossary term can be viewed in the **Overview Tab**.
- Users can discuss further about the term by **replying** on the task.
- Other users can be pulled into the conversation using **@mentions**.
- The approved terms will have the **Approved** label next to them.
- Similarly, the rejected terms will be marked as **Rejected**.

{% note noteType="Warning" %} 
In case, the glossary **does not have any Reviewers** assigned, then the glossary terms will be **Approved** by default.
