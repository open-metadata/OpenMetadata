# How to Visualize Test Results
## From the Quality Page
From the home page click on the `Quality` menu item on the vertical navigation. This will bring you to the quality page where you'll be able to see your test cases either by:
- entity
- test suite
- test cases

If you want to look at your tests grouped by Test Suites, navigate to the `By Test Suites` tab. This will bring you to the Test Suite page where you can select a specific Test Suite.

  caption="Test suite home page"
 /%}


From there you can select a Test Suite and visualize the results associated with this specific Test Suite.

## From a Table Entity
Navigate to your table and click on the `profiler & Data Quality` tab. From there you'll be able to see test results at the table or column level.
### Table Level Test Results
In the top panel, click on the white background `Data Quality` button. This will bring you to a summary of all your quality tests at the table level
