5. ### Set Default Data Filters

Configure default filters to control which databases, schemas, and tables are included or excluded during ingestion.

#### Default Database Filter Pattern
- **Includes / Excludes**:  
  To add a filter pattern, simply type it in and press `Enter`.

#### Default Schema Filter Pattern
- **Includes / Excludes**:  
  To add a filter pattern, simply type it in and press `Enter`.

#### Default Table Filter Pattern
- **Includes / Excludes**:  
  To add a filter pattern, simply type it in and press `Enter`.

These filters help streamline the ingestion process by targeting only the relevant data assets.
