# Getting Started

Welcome to OpenMetadata's unified platform for data discovery, observability, and governance. Our platform centralizes all data context to help you build high-quality data and AI assets. This guide provides the necessary information to set up your OpenMetadata environment in 30 minutes.

## How Does OpenMetadata Work?

OpenMetadata is designed to support both technical and non-technical data practitioners across various use cases, including data discovery, lineage, observability, quality, collaboration, governance, and insights.

The platform includes a library of 90+ turnkey connectors to easily ingest metadata from sources such as data warehouses, data lakes, streaming platforms, dashboards, and ML models. For custom data sources, APIs are available to streamline metadata ingestion. Metadata from these sources is organized into a Unified Metadata Graph, providing a single, comprehensive source of truth for your entire data estate.

This centralized metadata is accessible through a unified user interface, eliminating the need for practitioners to switch between multiple catalogs, quality, or governance tools. OpenMetadata can also be extended with applications, such as AI-driven productivity tools like Collate AI, or through custom-built workflows that integrate the platform with existing systems.
The platform’s native collaboration features support shared workflows, enabling different teams—data platform engineers, governance professionals, data scientists/analysts, and business users—to collaborate effectively in a single environment.
