# Container

*This schema defines the Container entity. A Container is an abstraction for any path(including the top level eg. bucket in S3) storing data in an Object store such as S3, GCP, Azure. It maps a tree-like structure, where each Container can have a parent and a list of sub-folders, and it can be structured - where it contains structured data, or unstructured where no schema for its data is defined.*

## Properties

- **`id`**: Unique identifier that identifies this container instance. Refer to *[../../type/basic.json#/definitions/uuid](#/../type/basic.json#/definitions/uuid)*.
- **`name`**: Name that identifies the container. Refer to *[../../type/basic.json#/definitions/entityName](#/../type/basic.json#/definitions/entityName)*.
- **`fullyQualifiedName`**: Name that uniquely identifies a container in the format 'ServiceName.ContainerName'. Refer to *[../../type/basic.json#/definitions/fullyQualifiedEntityName](#/../type/basic.json#/definitions/fullyQualifiedEntityName)*.
- **`displayName`** *(string)*: Display Name that identifies this container.
- **`description`**: Description of the container instance. Refer to *[../../type/basic.json#/definitions/markdown](#/../type/basic.json#/definitions/markdown)*.
