# Enable Secrets Manager

Secret Manager integrations allow you to use your existing third-party **Key Management Store** (KMS) with OpenMetadata. 
Your credentials and sensitive information are stored in a tool that you control, and the KMS will mediate between any 
OpenMetadata internal requirement and sensitive information.

Without a secret manager configured in OpenMetadata, all your sensitive data, any password field of a service connection 
parameters, bot credentials configuration or dbt configuration of an ingestion pipeline, were stored in MySQL (or 
Postgres) encrypted.

The following diagram shows how is the process between the OM server and Airflow workflows:

{% image src="/images/v1.7/deployment/secrets-manager/om-secrets-manager-disabled.png" alt="om-secrets-manager-disabled" /%}

As you can see, the `Workflow` consumed by Airflow contains the service information as an `EntityReference`. We use that 
reference to read the Service information, including its connection details. This information goes from 
`Database > OM > Airflow`.

When the Secrets Manager is enabled, sensitive information stop being stored in any system from OpenMetadata. Instead, 
the KMS will act as a mediator, as we can observe in the diagram below:

{% image src="/images/v1.7/deployment/secrets-manager/om-secrets-manager-enabled.png" alt="om-secrets-manager-enabled" /%}

In 0.13 and up, OpenMetadata will communicate through an interface to read/write sensitive information -- removing the 
need to store sensitive data in OM systems. This new interface works whether users keep using the underlying database of 
OpenMetadata to store credentials (as it was set up thus far) or any external system such as AWS Secrets Manager or AWS 
SSM Parameter Store.

In future releases, we will add support for additional Key Management Stores, such as Azure Key Vault or Kubernetes 
Secrets.

If youâ€™d like to contribute by creating the interface, check the implementation guide, or if you want to see a new one 
on the supported list, please reach out to us on [Slack](https://slack.open-metadata.org/).

If you are interested in enabling the secrets' manager feature, this is our list of supported Secrets Manager 
implementations:

- [AWS Secrets Manager](/deployment/secrets-manager/supported-implementations/aws-secrets-manager)
- [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](/deployment/secrets-manager/supported-implementations/aws-ssm-parameter-store)

Things to take into account when enabling the Secrets Manager feature:

1. The migration of all the sensitive data will be done automatically after restarting the OpenMetadata server, which 
can not be undone for the time being.
2. Only users with permissions can edit and retrieve the service connections. The connection parameters will be hidden 
for all other users.

## How it works

There are two types of secrets manager implementations.

### Managed secrets manager

All the sensitive data will be held automatically in the configured secrets manager, i.e., any password field stored in 
the connection parameters of a service, in a bot credentials configuration, or a dbt configuration of an ingestion 
pipeline.

For example, suppose we create a MySQL service with the name `mysql-test`. In that case, the connection password will be 
stored in the secrets manager using the secret id `/openmetadata/database/mysql-test/password`. When we retrieve the 
connection parameters from the service, the password field will have the value 
`secrets:/openmetadata/database/mysql-test/password`.

We can also use secrets already stored in our secrets vault using the same convention `secret:{secret_id}`.

All the sensitive data (the secrets ids in this case) values will be encrypted using the Fernet algorithm as extra 
security protection.  

### Non-managed secrets manager

On the other hand, the non-managed configuration allows flexibility on how we want to use our secrets vault. Instead of 
automatically storing all the sensitive data, we can use the secrets ids from our secrets vault following the convention 
`secret:{secret_id}` when filling in password fields of the connection parameters of a service, in a bot configuration, 
or a dbt configuration of an ingestion pipeline.

The rest of the values which don't follow the convention for using a secret will be encrypted using the Fernet algorithm 
as extra security protection.
