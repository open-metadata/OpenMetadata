# Kafka

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Kafka connector.

## Requirements

Connecting to Kafka does not require any previous configuration.

$$note
Note that the ingestion of the Kafka topics' schema is done separately by configuring the **Schema Registry URL**. However, only the **Bootstrap Servers** information is mandatory to extract basic metadata.
$$

You can find further information on the Kafka connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/messaging/kafka).

## Connection Details

$$section
### Bootstrap Servers $(id="bootstrapServers")

List of brokers as comma separated values of broker `host` or `host:port`. E.g., `host1:9092,host2:9092`
$$

$$section
### Schema Registry URL $(id="schemaRegistryURL")

URL of the Schema Registry used to ingest the schemas of the topics.

If you encounter issues connecting to the Schema Registry, ensure that the protocol is explicitly specified in the Schema Registry URL. For example:
- Use `http://localhost:8081` instead of `localhost:8081`.
The Schema Registry requires a properly formatted URL, including the protocol (`http://` or `https://`). While this differentiation is expected in the Schema Registry configuration, it may not be immediately apparent.

**NOTE**: For now, the schema will be the last version found for the schema name `{topic-name}-value`. An [issue](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/issues/10399) to improve how it currently works has been opened.
