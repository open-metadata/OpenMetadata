### Usage & Lineage

$$note
To get Query Usage and Lineage details, you need a Databricks Premium account, since we will be extracting this information from your SQL Warehouse's history API.
$$

You can find further information on the Databricks connector in the <a href="https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/databricks" target="_blank">docs</a>.

## Connection Details

$$section
### Scheme $(id="scheme")
SQLAlchemy driver scheme options. If you are unsure about this setting, you can use the default value.
$$

$$section
### Host Port $(id="hostPort")
This parameter specifies the host and port of the Databricks instance. This should be specified as a string in the format `hostname:port`. For example, you might set the hostPort parameter to `adb-xyz.azuredatabricks.net:443`.

If you are running the OpenMetadata ingestion in a docker and your services are hosted on the `localhost`, then use `host.docker.internal:3000` as the value.
$$

$$section
### Authentication Type $(id="authType")
Select the authentication method to connect to your Databricks workspace.

- **Personal Access Token**: Generated Personal Access Token for Databricks workspace authentication.

- **Databricks OAuth**: OAuth2 Machine-to-Machine authentication using a Service Principal.

- **Azure AD Setup**: Specifically for Azure Databricks workspaces that use Azure Active Directory for identity management. Uses Azure Service Principal authentication through Azure AD.
$$

## Sample Storage AWS S3 Config

$$section
### AWS Access Key ID $(id="awsAccessKeyId")
When you interact with AWS, you specify your AWS security credentials to verify who you are and whether you have permission to access the resources that you are requesting. AWS uses the security credentials to authenticate and authorize your requests (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html" target="_blank">docs</a>).
Access keys consist of two parts:
1. An access key ID (for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`),
2. And a secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`).
You must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.
You can find further information on how to manage your access keys <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html" target="_blank">here</a>
$$

$$section
### AWS Secret Access Key $(id="awsSecretAccessKey")
Secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`).
$$

$$section
### AWS Region $(id="awsRegion")
Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area in which AWS clusters data centers (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html" target="_blank">docs</a>).
As AWS can have instances in multiple regions, we need to know the region the service you want reach belongs to.
Note that the AWS Region is the only required parameter when configuring a connection. When connecting to the services programmatically, there are different ways in which we can extract and use the rest of AWS configurations. You can find further information about configuring your credentials <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#configuring-credentials" target="_blank">here</a>.
$$

$$section
### AWS Session Token $(id="awsSessionToken")
If you are using temporary credentials to access your services, you will need to inform the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secrets Access Key. Also, these will include an AWS Session Token.
You can find more information on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html" target="_blank">Using temporary credentials with AWS resources</a>.
$$

$$section
### Endpoint URL $(id="endPointURL")
To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. An *endpoint* is the URL of the entry point for an AWS web service. The AWS SDKs and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) automatically use the default endpoint for each service in an AWS Region. But you can specify an alternate endpoint for your API requests.
Find more information on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html" target="_blank">AWS service endpoints</a>.
$$

$$section
### Profile Name $(id="profileName")
A named profile is a collection of settings and credentials that you can apply to an AWS CLI command. When you specify a profile to run a command, the settings and credentials are used to run that command. Multiple named profiles can be stored in the config and credentials files.
You can inform this field if you'd like to use a profile other than `default`.
Find here more information about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html" target="_blank">Named profiles for the AWS CLI</a>.
$$

$$section
### Assume Role ARN $(id="assumeRoleArn")
Typically, you use `AssumeRole` within your account or for cross-account access. In this field you'll set the `ARN` (Amazon Resource Name) of the policy of the other account.
A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call `AssumeRole` for the `ARN` of the role in the other account.
This is a required field if you'd like to `AssumeRole`.
Find more information on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html" target="_blank">AssumeRole</a>.
$$

$$section
### Assume Role Session Name $(id="assumeRoleSessionName")
An identifier for the assumed role session. Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons.
By default, we'll use the name `OpenMetadataSession`.
Find more information about the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html#:~:text=An%20identifier%20for%20the%20assumed%20role%20session." target="_blank">Role Session Name</a>.
$$

$$section
### Assume Role Source Identity $(id="assumeRoleSourceIdentity")
The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the `AssumeRole` operation. You can use source identity information in AWS CloudTrail logs to determine who took actions with a role.
Find more information about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html#:~:text=Required%3A%20No-,SourceIdentity,-The%20source%20identity" target="_blank">Source Identity</a>.
$$

$$section
### Bucket Name $(id="bucketName")
A bucket name in Data Lake is a unique identifier used to organize and store data objects.
It's similar to a folder name, but it's used for object storage rather than file storage.
$$

$$section
### Prefix $(id="prefix")
The prefix of a data source refers to the first part of the data path that identifies the source or origin of the data.
It's used to organize and categorize data within the container, and can help users easily locate and access the data they need.
