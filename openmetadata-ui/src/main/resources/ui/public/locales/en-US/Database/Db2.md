# DB2

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the DB2 connector.

## Requirements

To create a new DB2 user please follow the guidelines mentioned [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/ko/samfess/8.2.0?topic=schema-creating-users-manually)

The user must have the below permissions to ingest the metadata:

- `SELECT` privilege on `SYSCAT.SCHEMATA` to fetch the metadata of schemas.
```sql
-- Grant SELECT on tables for schema metadata
GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.SCHEMATA TO USER_NAME;
```

- `SELECT` privilege on `SYSCAT.TABLES` to fetch the metadata of tables.
```sql
-- Grant SELECT on tables for table metadata
GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.TABLES TO USER_NAME;
```

- `SELECT` privilege on `SYSCAT.VIEWS` to fetch the metadata of views.
```sql
-- Grant SELECT on tables for view metadata
GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.VIEWS TO USER_NAME;
```

### Profiler & Data Quality

Executing the profiler Workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/workflow) and data quality tests [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality).

You can find further information on the DB2 connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/db2).
