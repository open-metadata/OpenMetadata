## Configuration

$$section

### Topic Filter Pattern $(id="topicFilterPattern")

Topic filter patterns are used to control whether to include Topics as part of metadata ingestion.

**Include**: Explicitly include Topics by adding a list of regular expressions to the `Include` field. OpenMetadata will include all Topics with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other Topics will be excluded.

For example, to include only those Topics whose name starts with the word `demo`, add the regex pattern in the include field as `^demo.*`.

**Exclude**: Explicitly exclude Topics by adding a list of regular expressions to the `Exclude` field. OpenMetadata will exclude all Topics with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other Topics will be included.

For example, to exclude all Topics with the name containing the word `demo`, add regex pattern in the exclude field as `.*demo.*`.

Checkout [this](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/metadata/filter-patterns/database#database-filter-pattern) document for further examples on filter patterns.

$$section
### Mark Deleted Topics $(id="markDeletedTopics")

Optional configuration to soft delete `topics` in OpenMetadata if the source `topics` are deleted. After deleting, all the associated entities like lineage, etc., with that `topic` will be deleted.
$$

$$section
### Override Metadata $(id="overrideMetadata")

Set the `Override Metadata` toggle to control whether to override the existing metadata in the OpenMetadata server with the metadata fetched from the source.

If the toggle is `enabled`, the metadata fetched from the source will override and replace the existing metadata in the OpenMetadata.

If the toggle is `disabled`, the metadata fetched from the source will not override the existing metadata in the OpenMetadata server. In this case the metadata will only get updated for fields that has no value added in OpenMetadata.

This is applicable for fields like description, tags, owner and displayName
