# BigQuery

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the BigQuery connector.

## Requirements

We need to enable the Data Catalog API and use an account with a specific set of minnimum permissions:

### Data Catalog API Permissions

- Go to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/datacatalog.googleapis.com" target="_blank">Google Cloud Data Catalog API</a> page,
- Select the `GCP Project ID` that you want to enable the `Data Catalog API` on,
- Click on `Enable API`, which will enable the Data Catalog API on the selected project.

### GCP Permissions

To execute the metadata extraction and Usage workflow successfully, the user or the service account should have enough permissions to fetch required data:

- `bigquery.datasets.get`
- `bigquery.tables.get`
- `bigquery.tables.getData`
- `bigquery.tables.list`
- `resourcemanager.projects.get`
- `bigquery.jobs.create`
- `bigquery.jobs.listAll`

Optional permissions, required to fetch policy tags
- `datacatalog.taxonomies.get` 
- `datacatalog.taxonomies.list` 

Optional permissions, required for Usage & Lineage workflow
- `bigquery.readsessions.create`
- `bigquery.readsessions.getData`


You can visit <a href="https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/bigquery/roles" target="_blank">this</a> documentation on how you can create a custom role in GCP and assign the above permissions to the role & service account!

You can find further information on the BigQuery connector in the <a href="https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/bigquery" target="_blank">docs</a>.


### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler Workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. The user should also be allowed to view information in `table_storage` for all objects in the database. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found <a href="https://docs.open-metadata.org/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/workflow" target="_blank">here</a> and data quality tests <a href="https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Connection Details

$$section
### Scheme $(id="scheme")

SQLAlchemy driver scheme options.
$$

$$section
### Host Port $(id="hostPort")

BigQuery APIs URL. By default, the API URL is `bigquery.googleapis.com`. You can modify this if you have custom implementation of BigQuery.
$$

$$section
### GCP Credentials Configuration $(id="gcpConfig")

You can authenticate with your BigQuery instance using either `GCP Credentials Path` where you can specify the file path of the service account key, or you can pass the values directly by choosing the `GCP Credentials Values` from the service account key file.

You can check <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-console" target="_blank">this</a> documentation on how to create the service account keys and download it.

If you want to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc" target="_blank">ADC authentication</a> for BigQuery you can just leave the GCP credentials empty.

$$

$$section
### Credentials Type $(id="type")

Credentials Type is the type of the account, for a service account the value of this field is `service_account`. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `type` key in the service account key file.
$$

$$section
### Include Policy Tags $(id="includePolicyTags")

Enable this to ingest BigQuery policy tags. Make sure the `Include Tags` option is enabled in the ingestion agent. If Include Policy Tags is disabled, the agent will only ingest labels according to the Include Tags setting.
$$

$$section
### Billing Project ID $(id="billingProjectId")

A billing project ID is a unique string used to identify and authorize your project for billing in Google Cloud.
$$

$$section
### Project ID $(id="projectId")

A project ID is a unique string used to differentiate your project from all others in Google Cloud. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `project_id` key in the service account key file. 
You can select a single project ID or multiple project IDs from the dropdown menu to specify which projects you want to connect to.
$$

$$section

```
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
MII..
MBQ...
CgU..
8Lt..
...
h+4=
-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
```

You will have to replace new lines with `\n` and the final private key that you need to pass should look like this:

```
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\nMII..\nMBQ...\nCgU..\n8Lt..\n...\nh+4=\n-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\n
```

$$

$$section
### Taxonomy Project ID $(id="taxonomyProjectID")

BigQuery uses taxonomies to create hierarchical groups of policy tags. To apply access controls to BigQuery columns, tag the columns with policy tags. Learn more about how you can create policy tags and set up column-level access control <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/column-level-security" target="_blank">here</a>

If you have attached policy tags to the columns of table available in BigQuery, then OpenMetadata will fetch those tags and attach it to the respective columns.

In this field you need to specify the id of project in which the taxonomy was created.
$$

$$section
### Taxonomy Location $(id="taxonomyLocation")

BigQuery uses taxonomies to create hierarchical groups of policy tags. To apply access controls to BigQuery columns, tag the columns with policy tags. Learn more about how you can create policy tags and set up column-level access control <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/column-level-security" target="_blank">here</a>

If you have attached policy tags to the columns of table available in BigQuery, then OpenMetadata will fetch those tags and attach it to the respective columns.

In this field you need to specify the location/region in which the taxonomy was created.
$$

$$section
### Usage Location $(id="usageLocation")

Location used to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT` to fetch usage data. You can pass multi-regions, such as `us` or `eu`, or your specific region such as `us-east1`.

Australia and Asia multi-regions are not yet supported.
$$

$$section
### Cost Per TiB $(id="costPerTB")

The cost (in USD) per tebibyte (TiB) of data processed during BigQuery usage analysis. This value is used to estimate query costs when analyzing usage metrics from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT`.

This setting does **not** affect actual billingâ€”it is only used for internal reporting and visualization of estimated costs.

The default value, if not set, may assume the standard on-demand BigQuery pricing (e.g., $5.00 per TiB), but you should adjust it according to your organization's negotiated rates or flat-rate pricing model.

## Sample Storage AWS S3 Config

$$section
### AWS Access Key ID $(id="awsAccessKeyId")

When you interact with AWS, you specify your AWS security credentials to verify who you are and whether you have permission to access the resources that you are requesting. AWS uses the security credentials to authenticate and authorize your requests (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html" target="_blank">docs</a>).

Access keys consist of two parts:
1. An access key ID (for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`),
2. And a secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`).

You must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.

You can find further information on how to manage your access keys <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html" target="_blank">here</a>
$$

$$section
### AWS Secret Access Key $(id="awsSecretAccessKey")

Secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`).
$$

$$section
### AWS Region $(id="awsRegion")

Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area in which AWS clusters data centers (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html" target="_blank">docs</a>).

As AWS can have instances in multiple regions, we need to know the region the service you want reach belongs to.

Note that the AWS Region is the only required parameter when configuring a connection. When connecting to the services programmatically, there are different ways in which we can extract and use the rest of AWS configurations. You can find further information about configuring your credentials <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#configuring-credentials" target="_blank">here</a>.
$$

$$section
### AWS Session Token $(id="awsSessionToken")

If you are using temporary credentials to access your services, you will need to inform the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secrets Access Key. Also, these will include an AWS Session Token.

You can find more information on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html" target="_blank">Using temporary credentials with AWS resources</a>.
$$

$$section
### Endpoint URL $(id="endPointURL")

To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. An *endpoint* is the URL of the entry point for an AWS web service. The AWS SDKs and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) automatically use the default endpoint for each service in an AWS Region. But you can specify an alternate endpoint for your API requests.

Find more information on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html" target="_blank">AWS service endpoints</a>.
$$

$$section
### Profile Name $(id="profileName")

A named profile is a collection of settings and credentials that you can apply to an AWS CLI command. When you specify a profile to run a command, the settings and credentials are used to run that command. Multiple named profiles can be stored in the config and credentials files.

You can inform this field if you'd like to use a profile other than `default`.

Find here more information about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html" target="_blank">Named profiles for the AWS CLI</a>.
$$

$$section
### Assume Role ARN $(id="assumeRoleArn")

Typically, you use `AssumeRole` within your account or for cross-account access. In this field you'll set the `ARN` (Amazon Resource Name) of the policy of the other account.

A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call `AssumeRole` for the `ARN` of the role in the other account.

This is a required field if you'd like to `AssumeRole`.

Find more information on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html" target="_blank">AssumeRole</a>.
$$

$$section
### Assume Role Session Name $(id="assumeRoleSessionName")

An identifier for the assumed role session. Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons.

By default, we'll use the name `OpenMetadataSession`.

Find more information about the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html#:~:text=An%20identifier%20for%20the%20assumed%20role%20session." target="_blank">Role Session Name</a>.
$$

$$section
### Assume Role Source Identity $(id="assumeRoleSourceIdentity")

The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the `AssumeRole` operation. You can use source identity information in AWS CloudTrail logs to determine who took actions with a role.

Find more information about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html#:~:text=Required%3A%20No-,SourceIdentity,-The%20source%20identity" target="_blank">Source Identity</a>.
$$

$$section
### Bucket Name $(id="bucketName")

A bucket name in Data Lake is a unique identifier used to organize and store data objects.

It's similar to a folder name, but it's used for object storage rather than file storage.
$$

$$section
### Prefix $(id="prefix")

The prefix of a data source refers to the first part of the data path that identifies the source or origin of the data.

It's used to organize and categorize data within the container, and can help users easily locate and access the data they need.
