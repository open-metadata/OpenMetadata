# Cockroach

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Cockroach connector.

## Requirements

### Profiler & Data Quality

Executing the profiler Workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/workflow) and data quality tests [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality).

You can find further information on the Cockroach connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/cockroach).
