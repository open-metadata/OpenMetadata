# Contributors

We ❤️ all contributions, big and small!

Read [Build Code and Run Tests](https://docs.open-metadata.org/developers/contribute/build-code-and-run-tests) for how to setup your local development environment. Get started with our [Good first issues](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good-first-issue%22).

We also recommend joining the OpenMetadata [Slack Workspace](https://slack.open-metadata.org/) to meet the team, stay up to date with product features, and chat with other contributors! 

Once joining our Slack we recommend Introducing yourself in the #introductions channel. Tell us a bit about yourself and how you are currently using OpenMetadata if you are.

If you need help getting started in contributing, you can reach out in the #support channel and ask if anyone would be available to get you up to speed or just answer some questions.  

If you just have suggestions for how to improve OpenMetadata you can submit your feedback in #feature-requests
