It provides metadata management, search capabilities, and governance features.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Metadata Management\n- Technical metadata (schemas, tables, columns)\n- Business metadata (glossaries, tags, descriptions)\n- Operational metadata (lineage, usage statistics)\n\n### 2. Search & Discovery\n- Full-text search across all assets\n- Faceted filtering by type, owner, tags\n- AI-powered recommendations\n\n### 3. Data Lineage\n- End-to-end data flow visualization\n- Impact analysis for changes\n- Dependency tracking\n\n### 4. Governance Features\n- Access control and permissions\n- Data quality metrics\n- Compliance tracking\n\n## Three Generations of Data Catalogs\n\n### Gen 1: Manual Cataloging\n- Heavy manual effort\n- Limited automation\n- Quickly becomes outdated\n\n### Gen 2: Automated Discovery\n- Connector-based ingestion\n- Automated metadata extraction\n- Schema inference\n\n### Gen 3: AI-Driven Intelligence\n- Automated classification\n- Smart recommendations\n- Natural language search\n- Predictive analytics\n\n## Modern AI Features\n\n- **Auto-tagging**: ML models automatically classify and tag data\n- **Quality Prediction**: AI predicts data quality issues before they occur\n- **Smart Search**: Natural language queries to find data\n- **Usage Patterns**: AI learns from user behavior to recommend relevant assets\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Start Small**: Begin with critical datasets\n2. **Engage Stakeholders**: Get buy-in from data owners\n3. **Automate**: Use automated discovery where possible\n4. **Govern**: Establish clear ownership and processes\n5. **Measure**: Track adoption and value metrics\n\nFor more information, visit the [Collate Learning Center](https://www.getcollate.io/learning-center?topic=data-catalog)"
