      "content": "# Building Data Products: From Raw Data to Trusted Assets\n\nA practical guide to creating and managing data products in modern data platforms.\n\n## What is a Data Product?\n\nA data product is a managed, discoverable, and trusted data asset designed for consumption by data users. It's data treated as a product with clear ownership, SLOs, and consumer focus.\n\n**Traditional Data Asset:**\n- Raw table in a database\n- No clear owner\n- Unknown quality or freshness\n- Users don't know if they can trust it\n\n**Data Product:**\n- Curated, documented dataset\n- Clear owner and support contact\n- Defined quality SLOs\n- Active monitoring and incident response\n- Consumer-focused design\n\n## Key Components of a Data Product\n\n### 1. Data Assets\nThe actual datasets (tables, views, dashboards) that comprise the product.\n\n**Example**: Customer 360 Data Product\n- `customer.profile` - Core customer attributes\n- `customer.activity` - Interaction history\n- `customer.segments` - Segmentation scores\n- `customer_360_dashboard` - Executive dashboard\n\n### 2. Metadata and Documentation\n- **Description**: What the data product provides\n- **Schema**: Field-level documentation\n- **Lineage**: Where data comes from and goes\n- **Sample Queries**: How to use the product\n- **Use Cases**: Who uses it and why\n\n### 3. Service Level Objectives (SLOs)\nMeasurable commitments to data consumers.\n\n**Common SLOs:**\n- **Freshness**: \"Updated daily by 9 AM UTC\"\n- **Quality**: \"<1% null rate in customer_id\"\n- **Availability**: \"99.9% query success rate\"\n- **Latency**: \"p95 query time <2 seconds\"\n- **Support**: \"Response to incidents within 4 hours\"\n\n### 4. Ownership and Support\n- **Product Owner**: Responsible for roadmap and prioritization\n- **Technical Owner**: Responsible for implementation and SLOs\n- **Domain**: Which business domain owns this product\n- **Support Channel**: Where to get help (Slack, email, etc.)\n\n### 5. Consumer Management\nTracking who uses the data product and for what.\n\n- **Known Consumers**: Teams and applications\n- **Usage Metrics**: Query volume, unique users\n- **Feedback Loop**: How consumers request changes\n\n## Creating Your First Data Product\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Need\n\nAsk these questions:\n1. **Who needs this data?** (Specific teams, roles, use cases)\n2. **What problem does it solve?** (Reporting, ML, analytics)\n3. **What are the requirements?** (Freshness, granularity, quality)\n4. **What's the business value?** (Decisions enabled, time saved)\n\n**Example**: Marketing team needs customer acquisition metrics for weekly reporting.\n\n### Step 2: Design the Product\n\n**Schema Design:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE marketing.customer_acquisition_metrics (\n  date DATE NOT NULL,\n  channel STRING NOT NULL,  -- organic, paid, referral\n  new_customers BIGINT,\n  acquisition_cost DECIMAL(10,2),\n  ltv_estimate DECIMAL(10,2),\n  CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (date, channel)\n);\n```\n\n**SLO Definition:**\n- Freshness: Updated daily by 10 AM\n- Quality: No nulls in date/channel, <5% nulls in metrics\n- Historical: 2 years of history retained\n\n**Consumers:**\n- Marketing Dashboard (Tableau)\n- Weekly executive report\n- Marketing Data Science team\n\n### Step 3: Build the Pipeline\n\n**Data Sources:**\n- CRM system (customer records)\n- Ad platforms (acquisition cost)\n- Product analytics (LTV estimates)\n\n**Transformation Logic:**\n```sql\nINSERT INTO marketing.customer_acquisition_metrics\nSELECT \n  c.signup_date AS date,\n  c.acquisition_channel AS channel,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS new_customers,\n  SUM(a.ad_spend) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS acquisition_cost,\n  AVG(l.ltv_score) AS ltv_estimate\nFROM customers c\nLEFT JOIN ad_spend a ON c.signup_date = a.date AND c.acquisition_channel = a.channel\nLEFT JOIN ltv_scores l ON c.customer_id = l.customer_id\nWHERE c.signup_date = CURRENT_DATE - 1\nGROUP BY c.signup_date, c.acquisition_channel;\n```\n\n**Orchestration:**\n- Runs daily via Airflow\n- Retries on failure\n- Sends alerts if SLOs breached\n\n### Step 4: Document in OpenMetadata\n\n1. **Create Data Product Entity**\n   - Name: \"Customer Acquisition Metrics\"\n   - Domain: Marketing\n   - Owner: Marketing Data Team\n   - Description: Comprehensive description\n\n2. **Add Data Assets**\n   - Link the `customer_acquisition_metrics` table\n   - Link the Tableau dashboard\n   - Add lineage to source systems\n\n3. **Define SLOs**\n   - Add freshness check (daily by 10 AM)\n   - Add quality tests (null checks, row count)\n   - Set up monitoring and alerts\n\n4. **Add Consumers**\n   - Document known consumers\n   - Provide contact info for support\n\n### Step 5: Monitor and Iterate\n\n**Daily Checks:**\n- Did pipeline run successfully?\n- Are SLOs met?\n- Any data quality issues?\n\n**Weekly Reviews:**\n- Usage metrics (who's querying?)\n- Consumer feedback\n- SLO compliance trends\n\n**Quarterly Reviews:**\n- Should we adjust SLOs?\n- Are consumers satisfied?\n- What features should we add?\n\n## Data Product Maturity Model\n\n### Level 1: Ad-Hoc Data\n- No clear owner\n- Undefined quality\n- No monitoring\n- Users don't trust it\n\n### Level 2: Managed Asset\n- Designated owner\n- Basic documentation\n- Manual quality checks\n- Some users trust it\n\n### Level 3: Data Product\n- Clear ownership and support\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Defined SLOs with monitoring\n- Automated quality checks\n- Most users trust it\n\n### Level 4: Mature Data Product\n- Product roadmap and backlog\n- Active consumer engagement\n- Continuous improvement\n- Self-service access\n- High user satisfaction\n- Treated like a software product\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Start with Consumers\n- Understand their needs first\n- Design for their use cases\n- Make it easy to discover and use\n- Provide examples and templates\n\n### 2. Make SLOs Realistic\n- Don't promise what you can't deliver\n- Start conservative, improve over time\n- Communicate changes to consumers\n- Track and publish SLO compliance\n\n### 3. Automate Everything\n- Automated testing\n- Automated monitoring\n- Automated alerts\n- Automated documentation (where possible)\n\n### 4. Treat It Like a Product\n- Roadmap of improvements\n- Feature requests from consumers\n- Regular releases\n- Versioning and changelogs\n- Deprecation policies\n\n### 5. Measure Success\n- Number of active consumers\n- Query volume trends\n- Consumer satisfaction scores\n- SLO compliance rates\n- Incidents per month\n\n## Common Challenges\n\n### Challenge 1: Unclear Ownership\n**Problem**: No one feels responsible for the data product\n\n**Solution**:\n- Assign explicit product owner (makes decisions)\n- Assign technical owner (maintains pipelines)\n- Include ownership in performance reviews\n- Rotate ownership thoughtfully, not casually\n\n### Challenge 2: SLO Violations\n**Problem**: Can't consistently meet SLOs\n\n**Solutions**:\n- Adjust SLOs to be more realistic\n- Invest in infrastructure improvements\n- Add redundancy and retries\n- Communicate degraded service to consumers\n\n### Challenge 3: Low Adoption\n**Problem**: Built it, but no one uses it\n\n**Solutions**:\n- Talk to potential consumers upfront\n- Make it easier to discover\n- Provide training and examples\n- Promote success stories\n- Sunset unused data products\n\n### Challenge 4: Scope Creep\n**Problem**: Product becomes too complex\n\n**Solution**:\n- Keep products focused on specific use cases\n- Split into multiple products if needed\n- Say \"no\" to off-roadmap features\n- Maintain product vision document\n\n## Data Product Patterns\n\n### Analytical Data Product\n- **Purpose**: Enable analysis and reporting\n- **Consumers**: Analysts, data scientists, executives\n- **Examples**: Revenue dashboards, customer segmentation, funnel metrics\n- **SLOs**: Freshness (daily/weekly), quality (high accuracy)\n\n### Operational Data Product\n- **Purpose**: Support business operations\n- **Consumers**: Applications, microservices, automation\n- **Examples**: Real-time inventory, fraud scores, recommendation engines\n- **SLOs**: Freshness (real-time/hourly), latency (milliseconds), availability (99.99%)\n\n### ML Data Product\n- **Purpose**: Train and serve ML models\n- **Consumers**: Data scientists, ML engineers, model serving\n- **Examples**: Training datasets, feature stores, model predictions\n- **SLOs**: Versioning (immutable), reproducibility, data drift monitoring\n\n## Metrics to Track\n\n**Product Health:**\n- SLO compliance rate\n- Incident frequency\n- Mean time to resolution\n- Data quality score\n\n**Consumer Satisfaction:**\n- Number of active consumers\n- Query volume\n- Support ticket volume\n- Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\n**Business Impact:**\n- Decisions enabled\n- Time saved vs manual processes\n- Revenue impact (if measurable)\n- Compliance improvements\n\nFor more information, visit the [Collate Learning Center](https://www.getcollate.io/learning-center?topic=data-products)"
