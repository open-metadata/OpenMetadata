Domains align data ownership with organizational structure.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Finance Domain**: Revenue tables, expense reports, financial dashboards\n- **Marketing Domain**: Campaign data, customer acquisition metrics, ad spend\n- **Product Domain**: Feature usage, product analytics, A/B test results\n- **Sales Domain**: Opportunities, leads, pipeline metrics\n\n## Why Use Domains?\n\n### 1. Clear Ownership\n- Each domain has designated owners\n- Ownership aligns with business org structure\n- Clear escalation paths for data issues\n- Accountability for data quality\n\n### 2. Better Discovery\n- Users find data by business context, not technical location\n- Browse data by department or function\n- Search within relevant domains\n- Reduce noise from irrelevant data\n\n### 3. Governance at Scale\n- Apply policies at domain level\n- Delegate administration to domain owners\n- Domain-specific access controls\n- Federated data governance model\n\n### 4. Aligned Incentives\n- Domain teams own their data quality\n- Data stewardship becomes part of job\n- Product teams responsible for product data\n- Finance teams responsible for financial data\n\n## Domain Architecture Patterns\n\n### Flat Domains\nSimple, non-hierarchical structure:\n```\n- Finance\n- Marketing\n- Product\n- Sales\n- Operations\n```\n**When to use**: Small to medium organizations with clear functional boundaries\n\n### Hierarchical Domains\nNested domains with parent-child relationships:\n```\n- Customer Data (parent)\n  - Customer Acquisition (child)\n  - Customer Success (child)\n  - Customer Support (child)\n- Revenue Data (parent)\n  - Product Revenue (child)\n  - Services Revenue (child)\n```\n**When to use**: Large organizations with complex structures\n\n### Hybrid Approach\nMix of flat and hierarchical:\n```\n- Core Domains (flat)\n  - Finance\n  - Legal\n- Product Domains (hierarchical)\n  - Product (parent)\n    - Analytics (child)\n    - Experimentation (child)\n```\n**When to use**: Most real-world scenarios\n\n## Creating Your First Domain\n\n### Step 1: Identify Domains\nAsk these questions:\n1. **Who are the natural data owners?** (Finance team, Marketing team, etc.)\n2. **How is your company organized?** (Departments, product lines, regions)\n3. **How do users think about data?** (By function, by product, by customer segment)\n\n**Start with 3-5 top-level domains** aligned with major business functions.\n\n### Step 2: Create the Domain\n1. Navigate to **Domains** in OpenMetadata\n2. Click **Add Domain**\n3. Provide:\n   - **Name**: Clear, business-aligned (e.g., \"Finance\")\n   - **Display Name**: \"Finance Domain\"\n   - **Description**: Scope and purpose of this domain\n   - **Domain Type**: Source-Aligned, Consumer-Aligned, or Aggregate\n   - **Owners**: Who governs this domain (e.g., CFO, Finance Director)\n   - **Experts**: Subject matter experts\n4. Click **Save**\n\n### Step 3: Add Data Assets\nAssign tables, dashboards, pipelines to your domain:\n1. Navigate to a data asset (e.g., a table)\n2. Click **Edit**\n3. Select **Domain** from dropdown\n4. Choose your domain\n5. Save\n\n**Bulk assignment**: Use CSV import or API to assign many assets at once.\n\n### Step 4: Define Domain Policies\nOptional but recommended:\n- **Data Quality SLAs**: Minimum quality standards for domain data\n- **Access Policies**: Who can view/edit data in this domain\n- **Tagging Requirements**: Mandatory tags for domain assets\n- **Documentation Standards**: Required metadata fields\n\n## Domain Ownership Models\n\n### Centralized Ownership\n- **Central data team owns all domains**\n- Pros: Consistent standards, easier to enforce governance\n- Cons: Bottleneck, less business context\n- **When to use**: Early-stage data programs\n\n### Federated Ownership\n- **Business teams own their domains**\n- Pros: Deep business knowledge, distributed responsibility\n- Cons: Risk of inconsistency, coordination overhead\n- **When to use**: Mature data organizations\n\n### Hybrid Ownership\n- **Business owns content, data team owns platform**\n- Pros: Best of both worlds\n- Cons: Requires clear RACI\n- **When to use**: Most organizations\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Align with Organization Structure\nDomains should mirror how your company is organized:\n- If you have a VP of Finance, create a Finance domain\n- If you have a Product org, create a Product domain\n- Make it intuitive for people to find their domain\n\n### 2. Keep Domains Stable\n- Domains should not change frequently\n- Avoid reorganizing domains with every company reorg\n- Domains are about data ownership, not current org chart\n\n### 3. Assign Clear Owners\nEvery domain needs:\n- **Executive Sponsor**: Senior leader (VP or Director)\n- **Data Steward**: Day-to-day manager\n- **Subject Matter Experts**: Domain specialists\n\n### 4. Start Top-Down, Fill Bottom-Up\n- Leadership defines top-level domains\n- Domain teams identify and assign their own data assets\n- Data team provides tooling and support\n\n### 5. Make It Self-Service\n- Domain owners can assign assets without central approval\n- Provide templates and guidelines\n- Automate where possible (e.g., auto-assign based on schema name)\n\n## Domain-Driven Data Products\n\nDomains are the foundation for data products:\n- **Domain**: Finance\n- **Data Product**: Daily Revenue Metrics\n  - **Inputs**: Orders, Refunds, Adjustments\n  - **Outputs**: `finance.daily_revenue` table\n  - **Consumers**: Executive dashboards, FP&A reports\n  - **SLAs**: Updated daily by 9 AM, <1% error rate\n\nEach domain can own multiple data products.\n\n## Common Challenges\n\n### Challenge 1: Cross-Domain Data\n**Problem**: Customer data used by both Marketing and Product\n\n**Solutions**:\n- Create a shared \"Customer\" domain\n- Designate one domain as primary owner\n- Use data products to share across domains\n\n### Challenge 2: Domain Boundaries\n**Problem**: Unclear where one domain ends and another begins\n\n**Solution**:\n- Document domain scope clearly\n- Use tagging for cross-cutting concerns\n- Accept some overlap is natural\n\n### Challenge 3: Orphaned Data\n**Problem**: Data that doesn't fit any domain\n\n**Solutions**:\n- Create \"Shared\" or \"Platform\" domain for common data\n- Assign to nearest domain temporarily\n- Review and reassign during regular audits\n\n### Challenge 4: Legacy Systems\n**Problem**: Old systems don't align with current domains\n\n**Solution**:\n- Create \"Legacy\" domain temporarily\n- Gradually migrate data to proper domains\n- Decommission legacy domain over time\n\n## Measuring Domain Success\n\n**Coverage Metrics:**\n- % of data assets assigned to domains\n- % of domains with active owners\n- % of critical datasets within domains\n\n**Engagement Metrics:**\n- Domain owner activity (edits, reviews)\n- User searches filtered by domain\n- Data requests routed to domain owners\n\n**Quality Metrics:**\n- Data quality by domain\n- Incident resolution time by domain\n- User satisfaction by domain\n\n## Advanced: Domain-Oriented Governance\n\nAs you mature:\n1. **Domain Budgets**: Allocate data infrastructure costs by domain\n2. **Domain Roadmaps**: Each domain has data improvement plans\n3. **Domain Metrics**: Track domain-level OKRs\n4. **Domain Reviews**: Quarterly business reviews per domain\n\nFor more information, visit the [Collate Learning Center](https://www.getcollate.io/learning-center?topic=domains)"
