It shows:\n- **Origins**: Where data is created or ingested\n- **Transformations**: How data is modified or combined\n- **Destinations**: Where data is consumed or stored\n- **Dependencies**: Relationships between data assets\n\n## Why Data Lineage Matters\n\n### 1. Impact Analysis\n**Question**: \"If I change this table schema, what will break?\"\n\nLineage shows all downstream consumers, allowing you to:\n- Identify affected dashboards, reports, and pipelines\n- Notify stakeholders before making changes\n- Plan migration strategies\n- Reduce production incidents\n\n### 2. Root Cause Analysis\n**Question**: \"Why is this report showing wrong numbers?\"\n\nTrace upstream to find:\n- Where bad data entered the system\n- Which transformation introduced the error\n- When the issue started occurring\n- Who owns the problematic asset\n\n### 3. Compliance and Auditing\n**Question**: \"Where does PII flow in our systems?\"\n\nLineage helps with:\n- GDPR/CCPA compliance (data deletion requests)\n- Tracking sensitive data movement\n- Audit trails for regulatory requirements\n- Data retention policies\n\n### 4. Data Discovery\n**Question**: \"Where can I find customer revenue data?\"\n\nLineage aids discovery by:\n- Showing popular data sources\n- Revealing trusted datasets\n- Understanding data provenance\n- Finding similar datasets\n\n## Types of Data Lineage\n\n### Table-Level Lineage\n- Shows relationships between tables/datasets\n- Easiest to implement and visualize\n- Good for high-level understanding\n- **Example**: `raw.orders` \u2192 `staging.orders` \u2192 `analytics.daily_revenue`\n\n### Column-Level Lineage\n- Tracks individual column transformations\n- More precise impact analysis\n- Harder to implement\n- **Example**: `orders.total_amount` is summed to create `daily_revenue.revenue`\n\n### Field-Level Lineage\n- Granular tracking within nested structures\n- Important for JSON/semi-structured data\n- Most detailed view\n- **Example**: `user.profile.email` flows to `customer.contact_email`\n\n## How Lineage is Captured\n\n### Static Analysis\n- Parse SQL queries and transformation code\n- Extract source and target tables\n- Build lineage graph from code\n- **Pros**: Works before execution, comprehensive\n- **Cons**: May miss dynamic behavior\n\n### Runtime Observation\n- Capture actual data flows during execution\n- Log queries and data movements\n- **Pros**: Accurate reflection of reality\n- **Cons**: Only captures what has run\n\n### Metadata Integration\n- Import lineage from transformation tools\n- Leverage dbt, Airflow, Databricks metadata\n- **Pros**: Authoritative source from tools\n- **Cons**: Requires integrations\n\n## Lineage in Modern Data Platforms\n\n### dbt Integration\n- Automatic lineage from dbt models\n- `ref()` and `source()` macros create graph\n- Column lineage from SQL parsing\n- Test and documentation in same place\n\n### Airflow Integration\n- DAG structure provides orchestration lineage\n- Task dependencies show execution order\n- Combine with data lineage for full picture\n\n### SQL Parsing\n- Parse `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `CREATE TABLE AS` statements\n- Extract table and column references\n- Build lineage graph automatically\n- Works across SQL dialects\n\n## Using Lineage Effectively\n\n### Impact Analysis Workflow\n1. Navigate to the asset you want to change\n2. View downstream lineage\n3. Identify critical consumers (dashboards, reports)\n4. Contact owners of affected assets\n5. Plan change rollout and communication\n\n### Troubleshooting Workflow\n1. Start at the problematic asset (e.g., dashboard showing wrong data)\n2. Trace upstream to source tables\n3. Check data quality tests at each hop\n4. Identify where data becomes incorrect\n5. Fix the root cause, not symptoms\n\n### Compliance Workflow\n1. Tag PII/sensitive columns in source systems\n2. Propagate tags through lineage\n3. Identify all locations of sensitive data\n4. Implement access controls and encryption\n5. Audit data access logs\n\n## Lineage Challenges\n\n### Dynamic SQL\n- Table names constructed at runtime\n- Hard to parse statically\n- Solution: Runtime capture or metadata hints\n\n### Complex Transformations\n- Stored procedures, UDFs, external code\n- Opaque logic\n- Solution: Manual documentation or instrumentation\n\n### Lineage at Scale\n- Thousands of tables, millions of columns\n- Graph becomes overwhelming\n- Solution: Filtering, search, levels of detail\n\n### Keeping Lineage Fresh\n- Code changes break lineage\n- Needs continuous updating\n- Solution: Automated re-parsing on commits\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Start with Critical Pipelines\n- Map lineage for most important data products\n- Focus on board-level metrics and reports\n- Prove value before expanding\n\n### 2. Automate Wherever Possible\n- Use tool integrations (dbt, Airflow)\n- Parse SQL automatically\n- Minimize manual documentation\n\n### 3. Combine with Data Quality\n- Show test results on lineage graph\n- Color-code by quality status\n- Make quality observable through lineage\n\n### 4. Make it Accessible\n- Don't hide lineage in engineering tools\n- Business users need lineage too\n- Provide intuitive visualizations\n\n### 5. Keep it Updated\n- Refresh lineage on every deployment\n- Detect and alert on drift\n- Archive old lineage for historical analysis\n\n## Lineage in OpenMetadata\n\nOpenMetadata provides:\n- **Automatic lineage** from dbt, Airflow, query logs\n- **Manual lineage** editing for custom flows\n- **Column-level lineage** for precise impact analysis\n- **Lineage filtering** by depth and direction\n- **Integration with data quality** tests\n- **Search within lineage** graph\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Lineage visualizes data flow through your organization\n- Essential for impact analysis, troubleshooting, and compliance\n- Multiple types: table, column, field-level\n- Captured via static analysis, runtime observation, or tool integration\n- Most effective when automated, up-to-date, and accessible\n\nFor more information, visit the [Collate Learning Center](https://www.getcollate.io/learning-center?topic=data-lineage)"
