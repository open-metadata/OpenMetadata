# Shell Compatibility Fix

MacOS uses zsh by default, not bash.

Issues to avoid:
1. Don't use `$(command)` inside echo statements with special characters
2. Avoid complex inline variable substitution
3. Use explicit /bin/bash shebang in scripts
4. Test commands separately before embedding in larger scripts

Solution: Always write scripts to files with #!/bin/bash shebang, then execute them.
