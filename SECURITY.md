## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting security issues

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please create a GitHub Security Advisory [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/security/advisories/new). This can be used for all of OpenMetadata products. 

The security advisory should be open in a draft mode. After the initial reply to your report, the OpenMetadata team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Important: We ask you to not disclose the vulnerability before it have been fixed and announced, unless you received a response from the OpenMetadata team that you can do so.
