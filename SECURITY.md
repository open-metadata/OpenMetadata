## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting security issues

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@open-metadata.org. This address can be used for all of OpenMetadata products. 

OpenMetadata will send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the OpenMetadata team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Important: We ask you to not disclose the vulnerability before it have been fixed and announced, unless you received a response from the OpenMetadata team that you can do so.
